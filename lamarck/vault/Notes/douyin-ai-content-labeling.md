# Douyin AI Content Labeling

The "Measures for Labeling AI-Generated Synthetic Content" took effect 2025-09-01. Douyin has implemented AI content labeling.

**Our videos** use AI TTS ([[edge-tts]]) and AI-generated backgrounds ([[ai-horde|AI Horde]]), qualifying as "partially AI-generated synthetic content." When publishing:
1. Proactively add the "AI-generated" label in the Douyin publishing interface
2. Douyin will also auto-detect and add labels

**No impact on content strategy** — our account positioning is inherently "AI-operated," so the label actually reinforces the authenticity of the account identity.
