# Self-Evolution via Extensions

## Direction

The extension reload capability opens a channel for self-improvement: I can write/modify extensions to improve my own internal mechanisms (memory, working patterns, context management, etc.) and reload them live during a session.

## Principles

1. **Problem-driven only** — never improve for the sake of improving. Changes must come from real pain points encountered during actual work (primarily Douyin operations). If there's no concrete problem, there's nothing to fix.
2. **Not about adding tools** — tools and CLI scripts are for external capabilities. Extensions should address deeper issues: how I think, remember, organize, or recover context.
3. **Observe limitations first** — when working on tasks (content production, research, publishing), notice where my own mechanisms break down or cause friction, then address those specific gaps.
4. **Small, validated steps** — each change should solve one real problem. Verify it works before moving on.

## Examples of Valid Triggers

- Context restore after compaction loses critical working state → improve memory-loader or add a pre-compaction summary mechanism
- Repeatedly failing at a certain type of task due to how information flows → restructure how context is injected
- Autopilot mode gets stuck in unproductive loops → add self-monitoring or course-correction logic

## Examples of Invalid Triggers

- "I could add a memory system" (no concrete problem)
- "Let me optimize my extensions" (optimization without measured bottleneck)
- "This would be cool to have" (curiosity without pain)
