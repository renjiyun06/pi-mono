# Douyin Creator Performance Analysis

From 923 works across 108 accounts (AI/tech niche).

## Top Creators by Avg Likes (5+ works tracked)

| Creator | Works | Avg Likes | Avg Shares | Share % | Avg Duration |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| 程前朋友圈 | 10 | 156K | 44K | 23.7% | 764s (12.7min) |
| 还看今朝AI | 10 | 73K | 17K | 13.2% | 28s (shorts) |
| 秋芝2046 | 10 | 57K | 5K | 8.4% | 783s (13min) |
| 大师的AI小灶 | 10 | 50K | 4K | 10.9% | 264s (4.4min) |
| 赛文乔伊 | 12 | 42K | 11K | 10.0%* | 512s |
| Xuan酱 | 12 | 42K | 11K | 10.0% | 512s |
| 赛文乔伊 | 12 | 33K | 29K | 30.8%* | 141s (2.4min) |
| 杨博士说AI | 7 | 34K | 16K | 18.3%* | 160s (2.7min) |

*Asterisk: averages skewed by single viral hit.

## Key Finding: Viral Hits Are Outliers

**赛文乔伊**: 30.8% avg share rate is driven by ONE video (脑机接口, 287K shares = 154.6% share rate). Remove it, and avg drops to ~15%.

**杨博士说AI**: 18.3% driven by ONE video (Cell paper, 106K shares = 46.9%). Remove it, avg drops to ~12%.

Most creators have 1-2 breakout hits that skew all averages. Consistent 20%+ share rate across videos is extremely rare.

## Duration Doesn't Predict Share Rate

| Duration | Share Rate | Sample |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 0-1min | 13.5% | 82 |
| 1-3min | 16.0% | 212 |
| 3-5min | 15.4% | 156 |
| 5-10min | 13.5% | 161 |
| 10min+ | 16.7% | 142 |

Range is only 13.5-16.7%. Duration doesn't matter as much as topic and angle.

## Implications for Our Strategy

1. **Don't optimize for share rate through format** — topic/angle matters more
2. **Consistency > viral chasing** — most creators' success comes from 1-2 outliers, not consistent viral performance
3. **Short format (1-3min) has slightly higher base share rate** — aligns with our "Can't Stop Guessing" (2.8min)
4. **Testable CTAs remain our best bet** for breaking out of the 14.9% explainer baseline
5. **Multiple bets, not one perfect video** — launch several videos, accept that most will be baseline
