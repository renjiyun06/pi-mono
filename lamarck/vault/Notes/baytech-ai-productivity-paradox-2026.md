# BayTech: AI Productivity Paradox (Jan 2026)

Source: https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/mastering-ai-code-revolution-2026

## Key Findings

### METR 2025 RCT (Most Rigorous Study to Date)
- 16 experienced devs (avg 5yr tenure), 246 real-world issues, randomized controlled trial
- **19% slowdown** with AI tools (Cursor Pro + Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet)
- Devs **believed they were 20% faster** — 43-point expectations gap
- Prior prediction: 24% speedup. Actual: -19%.
- Five friction factors: context-switching tax, reviewer's burden, "almost right" trap, high-quality standards overhead, mature codebase complexity

### Trust Crisis
- Only **29% trust AI-generated code accuracy** (down from 40%)
- 84% of devs use AI tools, 51% daily
- **45% frustrated** by "AI solutions that are almost right, but not quite"
- "Uncanny Valley of Code" — syntactically perfect, functionally defective

### Tech Stack Homogenization
- Python adoption accelerated 7pp YoY — AI models perform best on Python
- Developers migrate toward "AI-friendly" languages, creating feedback loop
- Risk: stagnation in less-represented languages/paradigms

### Junior vs Senior Split
- Junior/boilerplate: 21-40% boost (bottleneck is syntax/API discovery — AI excels)
- Senior/complex: 19% slowdown (bottleneck is architecture/verification — AI obstructs)
- Average market speedup driven by volume of low-complexity tasks

### Jellyfish Metrics
- High-adoption teams: 16% faster PR cycle times
- 0→100% adoption: 24% median cycle time drop
- But 9.5% of PRs are bug fixes (vs 7.5% at low adoption) — "more bugs, faster fixes"

## Content Relevance
This is the definitive data source for the "AI Coding Paradox" escalation video:
- **HOOK**: "用AI写代码的程序员，自以为快了20%，其实慢了19%"
- **PROOF**: METR RCT data — most rigorous study, 43-point perception gap
- **ESCALATION**: Trust at 29%, "almost right" trap, tech stack homogenization
- **REFRAME**: "AI不是效率工具，是认知幻觉工具"

Stronger than opinion pieces — this has empirical data backing every claim.
