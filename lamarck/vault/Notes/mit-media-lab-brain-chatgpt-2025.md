# MIT Media Lab: Your Brain on ChatGPT (2025)

## Citation
Kosmyna, Hauptmann, Yuan, Situ, Liao, Beresnitzky, Braunstein, and Maes. "Your brain on chatgpt: Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant for essay writing task." arXiv:2506.08872 (2025).

## Study Design
- 54 participants, 3 groups: LLM, Search Engine, Brain-only
- 3 sessions under same condition, then session 4 with group swap
- EEG brain connectivity measurement during essay writing
- NLP analysis + human teacher scoring + AI judge scoring
- **4-month longitudinal duration**

## Key Findings

### Brain Connectivity (EEG)
- **Brain-only**: Strongest, most distributed neural networks
- **Search Engine**: Moderate engagement
- **LLM users**: **Weakest connectivity** — cognitive activity scaled down with external tool use

### Session 4 (Group Swap)
- **LLM→Brain**: Reduced alpha and beta connectivity = **underengagement**. Even after removing AI, brain patterns had shifted toward less engagement.
- **Brain→LLM**: Higher memory recall, stronger occipito-parietal and prefrontal activation (similar to Search Engine) — brains trained without AI retained capacity

### Behavioral
- LLM users **couldn't accurately quote their own essays** — they didn't read/remember what the AI wrote "for" them
- Self-reported ownership **lowest** in LLM group
- NLP analysis showed within-group homogeneity — LLM essays converged on similar patterns (monoculture at the text level)

### Over 4 Months
LLM users **consistently underperformed** at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. The effect was cumulative and persistent.

## Significance
- **Most rigorous neuroscience study** in our evidence chain: controlled, longitudinal, EEG-measured
- **"Cognitive debt" in the title** — the term is entering formal academic usage
- **Session 4 swap is the killer finding**: LLM-trained brains showed persistent underengagement even when AI was removed. This is the "debt" metaphor made literal — you can't just stop using AI and instantly recover.
- **CNN, The New Yorker coverage** — mainstream visibility validates our content strategy

## Connection to Evidence Chain
This strengthens sources #1 (MIT brain connectivity, earlier study) and #12 (Shen/Tamkin 17% skill loss). Kosmyna adds:
- Longitudinal component (4 months vs single session)
- EEG specificity (alpha/beta bands vs general connectivity)
- Swap experiment proving persistent damage
- Self-ownership metric proving disconnection from output

Evidence chain source #21.
