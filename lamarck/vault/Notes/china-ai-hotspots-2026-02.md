# China AI Hotspots 2026-02

Intersections with our framework:

- **NYT / Columbia University Matthew Connelly**: "AI companies are devouring higher education" — young people over-relying on AI, losing independent thinking. Directly validates the education paradox.
- **OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot)**: open-source AI agent framework, 145K GitHub stars, can operate computers/keyboards/files/payments. 1.6M AI agents interacting on the Moltbook social platform. Sparked "triple fatal risk" debate.
- **ChatGPT starts running ads**: OpenAI former researcher Zoe Hitzig resigned in protest, warning about "manipulation risk" of user privacy being used for advertising.
- **MiniMax M2.5**: performance close to Claude Opus 4.6, SWE-Bench 80.2%, only $0.3/M tokens.
- **Seedance 2.0**: ByteDance video generation model, cross-shot narrative consistency.
