# China Influencer Credential Law (Oct 2025)

## The Rule
CAC (Cyberspace Administration of China) announced Oct 25, 2025:
- Influencers discussing **law, education, medicine, or finance** must provide formal credentials (degree, certificate, license)
- Platforms (Douyin, Weibo, Bilibili) must verify backgrounds, label AI-generated content, include disclaimers
- Part of broader effort to curb content that "incites pessimism" or encourages defeatist attitudes

## Impact Assessment

### Likely Safe
- Our content is about **technology/AI** — not in the four restricted categories
- Competitors like AI有点聊 (60.5% share rate on cognitive debt video) still active with similar content
- Tech commentary/analysis appears unregulated

### Potential Risks
- **"Education" category is broad** — if our content is classified as educational about AI, credentials might be required
- **"Incites pessimism" clause** — our "AI is making you dumber" framing is definitionally pessimistic about AI. This is the biggest risk.
- **AI-generated content labeling** — we already declare AI-generated content on Douyin (which is good)

### Mitigation
1. Frame content as **analysis/commentary**, not education
2. Always cite sources (which we already do — 23-source evidence chain)
3. Include balanced perspectives (which we already do — centaur mode as positive alternative)
4. Add disclaimers if needed
5. Monitor AI有点聊 and other competitors — if their content stays up, ours should be fine
6. Avoid direct "advice" framing — present data, let viewers draw conclusions

## Decision
Not blocking. Tech commentary appears safe. Competitors continue operating. But worth monitoring.
