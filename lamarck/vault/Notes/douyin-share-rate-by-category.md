# Douyin Share Rate by Content Category

Analysis of 923 works from 108 tracked accounts (mostly AI/tech creators).

## Key Finding: Explainers Have Lowest Share Rate

| Category | Count | Avg Likes | Avg Shares | Share Rate |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Celebrity (Musk etc.) | 13 | 37K | 32K | **38.4%** |
| Money/Success stories | 13 | 34K | 29K | **34.0%** |
| Society/Future impact | 10 | 23K | 7K | 18.1% |
| Tutorial/Review | 70 | 19K | 5K | 16.3% |
| **Explainer/Science** | **16** | **22K** | **3K** | **14.9%** |

Our content genre (AI self-narration / mechanism explainer) falls into the lowest-sharing category.

## Share Rate Distribution

| Bucket | Videos | Avg Duration |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 50%+ share rate | 17 | **258s (4.3min)** — shorter! |
| 30-50% | 43 | 459s |
| 20-30% | 114 | 391s |
| 10-20% | 320 | 540s (most common) |
| 5-10% | 148 | 397s |
| 0-5% | 119 | 230s |

## What Gets Shared Most (50%+ share rate)

Pattern in top-shared videos:
1. **Aspirational stories** — "96年女生赚1亿" (personal success)
2. **Big predictions** — Musk interviews, societal change warnings
3. **Practical tool demos** — "Manus实测" (immediately useful)
4. **Fear/urgency** — "每个人都会被假视频包围"

## Implications for Our Content

- Pure explainer content (our current genre) gets **likes but not shares**
- To increase share rate, we need one of:
  1. **Testable CTA** — "try this yourself" (our hallucination video has this)
  2. **Urgency/fear angle** — "AI can fool you, here's proof"
  3. **Practical utility** — link to a tool (hallucination checker)
  4. **Social proof** — celebrity angles (not our style)

The "Can't Stop Guessing" video + hallucination checker combo addresses items 1-3.
