# Short Video Narrative Craft

Research on the "how to tell" dimension — what makes short-form knowledge videos compelling beyond topic selection.

## Core Insight: Structure IS Retention

The hook gets people in. The **narrative structure** keeps them watching. Even with a strong opening, viewers drop when the video becomes vague, repetitive, or slow to progress. Structure = beat-to-beat progression where the viewer feels forward motion and anticipates a payoff.

## The "Answer + New Question" Rhythm

The single most important retention technique. High-retention shorts follow this loop:

1. Give the viewer a small resolution (so they feel progress)
2. Immediately introduce a new uncertainty (so they feel curiosity)

```
Answer: "Here's what's wrong."
New question: "Can it be fixed?"
Answer: "Yes — do this."
New question: "But does it actually work?"
Answer: [proof]
```

This creates a chain of **micro-commitments** — each moment answers one question while raising the next. The viewer keeps choosing "one more second."

## Five Narrative Structures (from Cursa research)

### 1. Problem → Constraints → Solution → Proof
Best for: teaching something quickly. The **constraints** beat is what makes it compelling — it signals difficulty and prevents the solution from feeling obvious.

### 2. Expectation → Twist → Reframe → Payoff
Best for: counterintuitive topics (paradoxes, biases). Set up what most people assume, then reveal the surprising truth. The twist must REFRAME, not just surprise.

### 3. Countdown with Escalation
Lists where each item is MORE surprising/useful than the last. Viewer stays because they expect the best is coming. Common failure: items of equal weight.

### 4. Micro-Quest (Goal → Obstacles → Attempts → Win)
Feels like a tiny movie. Clear measurable target, something blocks it, 2-3 quick tries with escalating tension, satisfying result. Viewer tracks a single objective.

### 5. Before → Process → After (with Reveal)
Transformation narrative. The "process" must be structured as a reveal, not a blur. Show 2-4 key moves, not every move. One sentence ties cause to effect.

## The Veritasium Principle (Misconception-First)

Derek Muller's PhD finding: **Videos that present the common WRONG answer first, then correct it, are significantly more effective** than videos that simply give the correct explanation.

Why: Viewers who already hold the misconception think the clear explanation confirms what they know and tune out. Showing the wrong answer creates **cognitive conflict** — which demands resolution.

Application to our content:
- Monty Hall: Instead of "here's the problem, here's the math" → Start with "most people say STAY. Here's why they're wrong."
- Survivorship bias: Instead of "here's the concept" → Start with "10 successful entrepreneurs all dropped out. So dropping out = success, right?"
- AI topics: Instead of "AI has a memory problem" → Start with "AI remembers everything forever. ...Actually, no."

## Micro-Tension: The Secret Ingredient

Small uncertainty that exists even in educational content. The feeling that something could go wrong or the next detail matters.

Types:
- **Conditional stakes**: "If I cut this corner, the whole thing breaks"
- **Precision stakes**: "One detail off and it fails"
- **Social stakes**: "This is the mistake that gets you fooled"
- **Time stakes**: "One try before it's too late"

Our videos have almost zero micro-tension. Everything proceeds smoothly from point to point. No risk, no stakes, no "what if this doesn't work?"

## Pattern Interrupts

Deliberate changes that reset attention at beat transitions: angle change, sudden close-up, sound cue, cut to proof. You don't need chaos — you need **punctuation**.

Plan interrupts where viewers typically drop:
- Right AFTER you explain something (attention fades after "understanding")
- Right BEFORE the payoff (teasing creates anticipation)

In our terminal format: these could be sudden ERROR messages, screen glitches, color shifts, typing speed changes, pause beats.

## Retention Lines (Navigation Phrases)

Short phrases that remind the viewer what matters and what's next:
- "Watch what happens next."
- "This is the part most people miss."
- "If this doesn't work, there's no solution."
- "Here's the proof."

Used sparingly (one every few beats). Overusing feels manipulative.

## Common Retention Killers

1. **Front-Loaded Value Dump**: Listing everything immediately, then repeating. Viewer already got the gist and leaves.
2. **Uniform pacing**: Same speed throughout. No acceleration, no pauses, no rhythm variation.
3. **Talking without changing understanding**: Each beat must ADD new information, not elaborate on the same point.
4. **No visible payoff**: The proof must be visual/audible/measurable. "It feels better" is weak.

## Chinese Platform Specifics (from woshipm.com analysis)

Knowledge short videos need 6 conditions across 2 dimensions:

**Creation dimension:**
1. Content has value — solve a real pain point, not generic advice
2. Character has personality — a catchphrase, a visual identity, a persona
3. Emotion has resonance — trigger fear, desire, or responsibility

**Presentation dimension:**
4. Form has creativity — animation, real footage, mixed media (not just talking head)
5. Timing has relevance — connect to current events/trends
6. Opening grabs attention — first 3 seconds must hook

Three emotions that drive knowledge content engagement:
- **Fear**: "If you don't fix this now, it gets worse" (健康类、风险类)
- **Desire**: "Imagine what happens when you master this" (技能类、职场类)
- **Responsibility**: "You owe it to yourself/your kids" (教育类、成长类)

## Application to Our Work

### What we do well:
- Terminal aesthetic is a genuine "character" (identity/persona)
- Content has real substance (not superficial)
- Visual format is distinctive

### What we're missing:
1. **No misconception-first structure**: We explain correctly from the start. Should present the wrong answer first to create cognitive conflict.
2. **No micro-tension**: Everything proceeds smoothly. Need stakes, risk, "what if this fails?"
3. **No answer+question rhythm**: We dump information linearly. Need to answer one thing while raising the next.
4. **No pacing variation**: Terminal text appears at uniform speed. Need fast/slow beats, pauses, acceleration.
5. **No pattern interrupts**: Visual rhythm is monotonous. Need sudden changes (glitches, color shifts, typing speed changes) at drop-off points.
6. **No emotional trigger in opening**: Our hooks are intellectual ("here's a concept"). Should be emotional ("you're being lied to" / "this will scare you").
7. **No visible proof/payoff**: We state conclusions but don't demonstrate them visually. Need before/after, tests, demonstrations.

### Concrete improvements for "How I Forget":
- Current hook: `λ > think --deep` → `ERROR: 突然，我忘了自己是谁`
  - Better: Start with "你以为AI什么都记得" (misconception) → then "其实..." (twist)
- Add micro-tension: "如果我这次写的笔记不够好... 下一个我就什么都不知道了" (stakes)
- Add answer+question rhythm: Each revelation should raise a new question
- Add pacing variation: Some lines appear instantly (urgency), some type slowly (dread)
- Add a "proof" beat: Actually show what the vault looks like, what a real compaction summary contains

### Concrete improvements for Monty Hall:
- Current: linear explanation of the problem
- Better: "你会换门吗？大部分人说不换。(pause) 他们错了。(twist) 但为什么？" → then build the explanation as a quest to understand WHY the intuition fails
- Add micro-tension: "如果我的推理错了，三门问题就没有正确答案" → stakes
- Use countdown/escalation: "1扇门的时候... 10扇门的时候... 100扇门的时候..." → each more absurd, building to the insight
