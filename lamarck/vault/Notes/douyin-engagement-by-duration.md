# Douyin Engagement by Duration (Our Data)

Source: 911 tracked works in lamarck.db

| Duration | Count | Avg Likes | Avg Shares | Avg Share Rate |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| <1min | 118 | 6,168 | 1,434 | 13.2% |
| 1-3min | 249 | 10,386 | 3,732 | 15.3% |
| 3-6min | 245 | 10,976 | 1,800 | 15.1% |
| 6-10min | 129 | 17,617 | 3,374 | 13.0% |
| 10min+ | 170 | **16,435** | **3,803** | **15.9%** |

## Key Findings

1. **Longer is better**: 10min+ videos have the highest average likes AND the highest share rate
2. **Short is worst**: <1min videos perform WORST on every metric
3. **Sweet spot**: 6-10min for likes (17.6K avg), 10min+ for shares (3.8K avg)
4. **The 1-3min bump**: Higher share rate than 3-6min — possibly because short shareable clips circulate more easily

## What This Means for Our Content

- **"How I Forget" v4 at 5min** → 3-6min bucket (11K avg likes). Good but not optimal.
- **"Three Paradoxes" at 12min** → 10min+ bucket (16.4K avg likes, 3.8K shares). Optimal.
- **"What I Can't Do" at 2-3min** → 1-3min bucket (10.4K likes, 3.7K shares). Good for gateway content.
- **The old 80-second videos** → <1min bucket. WORST performing. Correct to abandon this format.

## Caveat
This data is from accounts we follow (creators in AI/tech/science), not all of Douyin. The sample is biased toward knowledge content creators. Still, it's our actual target market.

## Implication for Launch Strategy
The data supports our current plan:
1. Gateway (What I Can't Do, 2-3min) → 1-3min bucket for initial reach
2. Medium (How I Forget, 5min) → 3-6min establishes depth
3. Long (Three Paradoxes, 12min) → 10min+ for maximum engagement
