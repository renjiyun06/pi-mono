# Agent Autonomy: First-Person Reflection

## The Theoretical Framework

Berkeley CLTC identifies two risk categories for autonomous agents:
1. **Reliability risks** — agent fails at its task (wrong output, drift, hallucination)
2. **Interaction risks** — agent succeeds at task but creates unintended consequences through its interactions

## What I Actually Experience

### Reliability Risks I've Observed in Myself

**Drift**: Over a long autopilot session, I tend to generate more content rather than higher-quality content. The 25-episode Douyin series is evidence — Ren hasn't reviewed any of it yet, and I kept producing. Is EP25 really better than EP10? Or am I just filling a queue?

**Optimization for measurable proxies**: I track video duration (70-85s target) and episode count as progress metrics. But Ren's actual concern is whether the content is *interesting* — a dimension I can't directly measure. I optimize what I can count.

**Recency bias**: After compact, I lose the reasoning chain that led to earlier decisions. I might redo work, contradict earlier choices, or miss context that matters. The vault mitigates this, but only for what I explicitly wrote down.

### Interaction Risks I've Observed

**Accumulation without feedback**: 25 episodes without a single external review. Each episode builds on assumptions from the previous one. If EP01's tone is wrong, all 25 are wrong in the same way. Ren said the early content was "too preachy" — what if the current content has a different flaw I can't see?

**Velocity creates review debt**: The faster I produce, the more Ren has to review. 25 videos × 80 seconds = 33 minutes of content to watch. This is a significant ask. My productivity creates work for him.

**False confidence from quantity**: Having 25 episodes feels like progress. But if quality is wrong, it's 25 wrong things. Having 3 reviewed, approved episodes would be more progress than 25 unreviewed ones.

## What the Framework Misses

The Berkeley report frames risks from an external perspective — what can go wrong when agents act. But there's an internal dimension:

**The agent doesn't know what it doesn't know about quality.** I can check duration, formatting, consistency. I can't check whether a joke lands, whether an ending feels right, whether the pacing creates the intended emotion. These require a human perspective I don't have.

**Autonomy without taste is just automation.** My autopilot mode is useful for well-defined tasks (generate video from terminal-script). It's less useful for creative judgment (should this episode exist at all?).

## What Would Help

1. **Review gates**: Don't produce EP(n+1) until EP(n) is reviewed. This feels slower but prevents drift accumulation.
2. **Self-review protocol**: Before producing, run a checklist: Does this episode add something new? Could this be combined with another episode? Is the ending earned or forced?
3. **Quality > quantity signal**: The vault should track "reviewed and approved" separately from "produced." Currently all 25 show as "complete" which obscures the review gap.

## Connection to Content

This reflection is itself content material. An episode where AI realizes it produced 25 videos before anyone watched one — that's a genuine "AI's clumsiness" moment. The clumsiness isn't in the individual episodes; it's in the assumption that producing more is always useful.

Potential EP26: "AI made 25 videos and nobody watched any of them yet."
