# MCP Adoption: Year in Review (2025)

Source: Pento.ai "A Year of MCP" (Dec 2025)

## Key Stats
- **97 million** monthly SDK downloads (Python + TypeScript)
- **10,000+** active MCP servers
- First-class client support: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, VS Code
- MCP donated to **Linux Foundation** (Agentic AI Foundation) — Dec 2025
- Co-founders: Anthropic, OpenAI, Block. Members: AWS, Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, Bloomberg

## Timeline
- Nov 2024: Anthropic open-sources MCP
- Mar 2025: OpenAI adopts MCP
- Apr 2025: Google DeepMind confirms MCP for Gemini
- Nov 2025: Major spec update (async, statelessness, registry)
- Dec 2025: Donated to Linux Foundation

## Relevance to Understand
MCP is the right distribution path. 97M monthly downloads = massive developer reach. Publishing understand-mcp to npm means any MCP client can quiz developers on code comprehension. The timing (early 2026) is like publishing an npm package in 2012 — early enough for first-mover attention in the MCP ecosystem.
