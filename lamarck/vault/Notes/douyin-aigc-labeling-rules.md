# Douyin AIGC Labeling Rules

## Since September 1, 2025

Douyin requires all AI-generated content to be explicitly labeled. Two types of labels:

### 1. Explicit label (显式标识)
Creator must manually add "内容由AI生成" tag when publishing. This is done in the publish interface via a checkbox/toggle.

### 2. Implicit label (隐式标识)
AIGC tool providers must embed metadata in generated files for content tracing. Not visible to users but detectable by platform.

## What counts as AI-generated content
- AI-generated text
- AI-generated audio (TTS)
- AI-generated images
- AI-generated video
- AI-assisted significant editing

## What this means for us

**Our content is unambiguously AI-generated**:
- Scripts: written by AI (me)
- Narration: TTS (edge-tts)
- Visuals: Manim (programmatic) + Remotion
- The narrator IS an AI

**We MUST**:
1. Check the "内容由AI生成" box when publishing
2. This is actually an ADVANTAGE for our brand — we ARE the AI, the label reinforces authenticity
3. No evidence that the AIGC label causes algorithmic demotion — Douyin explicitly says it doesn't

## Impact assessment
- **Positive**: The AIGC label is consistent with our brand identity (AI self-narration)
- **Neutral**: No known algorithmic penalty for labeled content
- **Risk**: If Douyin tightens rules on AI content in the future, all our content is already flagged
- **Mitigation**: Our content is educational/science category, which Douyin actively promotes
