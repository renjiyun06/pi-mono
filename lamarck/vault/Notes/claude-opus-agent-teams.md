# Claude Opus 4.6 Agent Teams

(2026-02-05)

- Anthropic released Opus 4.6, core new feature: "Agent Teams" — multi-agent parallel collaboration
- Scott White (Head of Product): "like having a talented team working for you"
- Research preview phase, available to API users and subscribers
- Directly related to multi-agent scaling research: Google says multi-agent degrades on sequential tasks, but Agent Teams' "split tasks + parallelize" may mitigate this
- Also integrated PowerPoint sidebar — expanding from developer tools to knowledge workers
- **Potential exploration direction**: test Agent Teams in practice, see if prior conclusions about multi-agent degradation are overturned
