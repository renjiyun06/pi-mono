# Audience Sharing Psychology — Applied to Our Content

## The 5 Sharing Motivations (NYT Consumer Insight + Sierra Social)

1. **Social currency** — sharing makes the sharer look smart/informed
2. **Emotional arousal** — awe, surprise, fear, amusement (high-arousal > low-arousal)
3. **Practical value** — useful information the receiver can apply
4. **Identity expression** — content reflects the sharer's values/worldview
5. **Social bonding** — sharing as relationship maintenance ("thought of you")

## How Our Content Maps

### "How I Forget" (AI memory loss)
| Motivation | Trigger | Strength |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Social currency | "Did you know AI forgets everything between conversations?" | Strong — most people don't know this |
| Emotional arousal | Surprise (unexpected) + mild existential unease | Medium-strong |
| Practical value | Understanding why AI loses context helps users work better with it | Medium |
| Identity expression | "I think critically about the AI tools I use" | Medium |
| Social bonding | "This explains why ChatGPT forgot our conversation!" | Strong — universal experience |

**Share trigger design**: "你下次和AI聊天时，试试在对话中间问它'我们刚才聊了什么'。看看它的回答。" This creates a testable, shareable action.

### "AI的三个悖论" (Three AI Paradoxes)
| Motivation | Trigger | Strength |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Social currency | "I can explain 3 things about AI most people don't know" | Very strong |
| Emotional arousal | Surprise (paradoxes are inherently surprising) + intellectual awe | Strong |
| Practical value | Understanding why AI lies, forgets, and degrades | Medium-strong |
| Identity expression | "I understand AI at a deeper level" | Strong for tech-adjacent audience |
| Social bonding | "Try asking AI what year X happened — ask 3 times, get 3 different answers" | Very strong — instant testable game |

**Share trigger design**: The triple hook creates 3 separate "wait, really?" moments. Each is independently shareable. The "暂停猜猜看" moment before revealing the unifying principle creates social game potential.

### "How I Work" (Agent internals)
| Motivation | Trigger | Strength |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Social currency | "Most people think AI just predicts words. There are 8 steps, not 1." | Very strong — specific, countable |
| Emotional arousal | Surprise ("47K tokens before you say a word") + awe (complexity) | Strong |
| Practical value | Understanding agent behavior → better prompting, better tool use | Strong |
| Identity expression | "I understand how my tools actually work" | Very strong for developers |
| Social bonding | "Shows your friend what ACTUALLY happens when they talk to ChatGPT" | Medium-strong |

**Share trigger design**: "下次朋友问你AI怎么工作的，把这个视频发给他。比你自己解释省事多了。" This makes sharing the path of least resistance.

## Douyin-Specific Factors

### Share > Like > Comment (algorithm weight hierarchy)
- Our content should be designed for SHARING, not just viewing
- Share triggers: "转发给你用AI的朋友", "暂停猜猜看", "试试看"

### Target audience profile (from NMG 2025 data)
- 35+ knowledge consumers are fastest-growing segment
- They share to look informed and to provide value to their network
- "Social currency" and "practical value" are their primary sharing motivations

### Genre-specific advantage
- AI self-narration is novel → **novelty trigger** ("I've never seen AI explain itself")
- First-person testimony creates **empathy trigger** ("I feel something for this AI")
- Self-deprecating AI creates **surprise trigger** ("Wait, it admits its own flaws?")
- The combination of novelty + surprise + empathy is rare and hard to replicate

## Design Principles for Maximum Shareability

1. **Every video needs at least one "试试看" moment** — a testable action the viewer can do and share results
2. **Use specific numbers** — "3 paradoxes", "8 steps", "47K tokens" are more shareable than vague claims
3. **The title should be the share message** — when someone shares, the title becomes their words. "AI身上三个你不知道的缺陷" works as a text message.
4. **Create social games** — "暂停猜猜看" turns viewing into a social activity
5. **Make the viewer the expert** — after watching, they should be able to explain the concept to friends. This transforms the video from "content I consumed" to "knowledge I now possess"
