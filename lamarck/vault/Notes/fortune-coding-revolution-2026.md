# Fortune: Developers Abandoned Traditional Programming (Feb 2026)

Source: https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/openais-codex-and-anthropics-claude-spark-coding-revolution-as-developers-say-theyve-abandoned-traditional-programming/

## Key Claims
- **GPT-5.3-Codex** + **Claude Opus 4.6** launched same week
- Boris Cherny (head of Claude Code): hasn't written code in 2+ months
- **90% of Claude Code's own code written by Claude Code** — recursive
- Spotify co-CEO: best developers haven't written code since December
- Matt Shumer viral essay: AI disrupts jobs worse than COVID (Gary Marcus called it "weaponized hype")

## Steve Yegge "AI Vampire"
- Developers falling asleep after long AI coding sessions
- Colleagues considering nap pods
- "Building things with AI takes a lot of human energy"
- 10x productivity → 10x workload expectation → burnout
- Different from cognitive debt: not "don't understand code" but "unsustainable energy drain"

## Content Angle
- "Your boss sees 10x productivity. You feel 10x exhaustion."
- The AI vampire: AI doesn't replace your job, it vampires your energy
- Combines with burnout study (ICSE 2026) and Anthropic's own study
- Escalation format: HOOK (Anthropic head hasn't coded in 2 months) → PROOF (90% recursive) → ESCALATION (Spotify, Yegge burnout, nap pods) → REFRAME (the faster you go, the more it costs)
