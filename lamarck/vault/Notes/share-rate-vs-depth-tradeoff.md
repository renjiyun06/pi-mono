# Share Rate vs. Depth Tradeoff

## Evidence from Our Data

| Video | Likes | Share Rate | Depth | Duration |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| 脑机接口 (赛文乔伊) | 185K | **154.6%** | None (pure awe) | 81s |
| 96年女生1亿营收 | 320K | **105.9%** | Low (story) | 13min |
| AI数不清手指 | 150K | 9.3% | High (CLIP explained) | 7min |
| 国家怎么看AI对就业 | 15K | 50.7% | Medium (policy analysis) | 5min |

## Pattern
- **Highest share rate**: Emotional triggers (awe, fear, anxiety). Zero explanation needed. "You HAVE to see this."
- **Highest absolute likes**: Entertaining + novel (AIGC short drama, AI image generation)
- **Knowledge content**: Lower share rate (9-30%) but builds authority and repeat viewers

## The Two Share Triggers

1. **Emotional contagion** (脑机接口 style): "OMG" → share. No learning. High share rate but disposable — viewers don't come back.
2. **Social currency** (手指 style): "I know something cool" → share. Requires understanding. Lower share rate but builds audience relationship.

## Our Strategy: Testable Actions as Bridge

We can't compete on pure awe (we don't have exclusive footage of paralyzed people playing COD). But we can create **testable share triggers**:

- "试试问AI贝多芬的第十交响曲" — viewer tests, gets a funny wrong answer, shares
- "打开旧对话问AI'我们上次聊了什么'" — viewer discovers AI has no memory, shares
- "让AI描述蒙娜丽莎然后问'你真的看过吗'" — viewer has an aha moment, shares

These combine BOTH triggers:
1. **Emotional**: "Whoa, AI can't say 'I don't know'!" (surprise/concern)
2. **Social currency**: "I understand WHY this happens" (knowledge flex)

The testable action is the bridge between depth and shareability.

## Implication for Content Calendar
- **Gateway content** (What I Can't Do, 2-3min): Optimize for share triggers. Each episode = 1 testable action.
- **Medium content** (How I Forget, 5min): Depth + 1-2 share triggers mid-video.
- **Deep content** (Three Paradoxes, 12min): Authority building. Share rate will be lower but generates followers.

Don't chase 154% share rate. That requires abandoning our genre. Aim for 20-30% share rate with genuine depth — that's where our audience (35+ knowledge consumers) lives.
