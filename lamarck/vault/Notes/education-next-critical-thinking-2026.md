# AI Didn't Destroy Critical Thinking. We Did.

Source: Education Next, Feb 2026. Dan Sarofian-Butin.

## Core Argument

There was no golden age of critical thinking before AI. The education system was already failing:
- NAEP shows only a small % of U.S. students reach "proficient" in reading/writing
- Collegiate Learning Assessment: students "academically adrift," learning almost nothing in college
- Pre-ChatGPT concerns: schools were boring, couldn't teach critical thinking, communication, or problem-solving

AI didn't erode critical thinking — it **exposed how poorly we teach it**.

## Supporting Data

- AAC&U survey: 95% of faculty believe AI increases overreliance, 90% believe it diminishes critical thinking
- Brookings report: "risks of AI in education overshadow benefits" — uses terms like "cognitive decline," "cognitive atrophy"
- MIT brain imaging study: long-term AI use may cause "diminished critical inquiry, increased vulnerability to manipulation"

## Counter-Position

The author uses AI as:
- Daily tutor
- Socratic conversation partner
- Writing mentor

Student reflection: "We are being taught how to think rather than what to think, and AI has been a great tool during this process."

## Connection to Our Framework

This **enriches** the cognitive debt narrative, not contradicts it:
1. Cognitive debt is real (replacement mode causes atrophy)
2. But the pre-AI baseline wasn't great either (factory education)
3. The solution isn't banning AI — it's teaching extension mode (centaur)
4. Understand tool embodies exactly this: use AI, but verify you understood

The author's classroom approach (AI as Socratic partner) is essentially what Understand does for code: forces the human to think, not just accept.

## Quotable

> "AI, in other words, did not erode critical thinking; it exposed how poorly we have been teaching it."

> "Prohibitions and nostalgia for a pre-AI world are the real dangers."
