# Douyin Launch Playbook

Cross-dimension synthesis of all research into actionable launch guidance. Combines insights from: algorithm mechanics, narrative craft, cover design, creator landscape analysis, content strategy, and audience psychology.

## The Problem

We have 60+ rendered videos, 25 episodes of a complete series, and 5 ready-to-publish short videos. But we've never published anything public. Our account has 21 views/week, 9% completion rate — effectively cold start.

The question isn't "what to publish" but "how to maximize the chance that what we publish actually gets seen."

## Synthesis: What Determines Success

Combining all research dimensions, success on Douyin cold start requires winning at **5 layers simultaneously**:

### Layer 1: Scroll-Stop (Cover + First Frame)
**Source**: Cover design research, algorithm transparency

The user scrolls at ~300ms per item. Your cover must win in that window.

**Requirements**:
- Title text ≥ 1/3 of cover height (readable at thumbnail size)
- Maximum 2 visual elements (text + one image/graphic)
- High contrast against dark Douyin feed background
- Cover must create a **question** in the viewer's mind, not answer one
- "Left text, right image" layout: +40% CTR vs text-only

**Our gap**: Current covers are just video frames — tiny text, vast empty space, no visual hierarchy. Need dedicated cover designs.

**Terminal aesthetic cover formula**:
- Large bold Chinese title (white or green on dark)
- One terminal element below (ERROR box, progress bar, or λ prompt)
- Brand color: green λ on near-black background
- Example: "AI从不忘记" in large text + red ERROR box below = scroll-stop

### Layer 2: Hook (0-3 seconds)
**Source**: Narrative craft, Veritasium principle, algorithm mechanics

Algorithm measures early drop-off. First 3 seconds decide if the video gets shown to more people.

**Requirements**:
- Open with a **misconception** or **bold claim** the viewer will want to challenge
- Visual motion must begin immediately (no static frames)
- First line of text/narration must create cognitive tension

**Hook formulas that work**:
1. Misconception-first: "你以为AI什么都记得" (then break it)
2. Bold claim: "AI比你更会忘记" (counterintuitive)
3. Direct challenge: "你确定你的童年记忆是真的吗？" (personal)
4. Stakes: "如果AI忘了你是谁..." (conditional threat)

**Our gap**: v1 videos open with commands/actions, not misconceptions. v2 of "How I Forget" fixes this.

### Layer 3: Retention (3s to end)
**Source**: Narrative craft frameworks, micro-tension, pacing research

Must maintain forward motion beat-by-beat. The viewer should never feel "I got it, I can leave."

**Retention architecture**:
- **Answer+Question rhythm**: Every beat resolves one question while raising another
- **Micro-tension**: Conditional stakes every 10-15s ("if this fails...")
- **Pacing variation**: Fast → slow → instant → pause (not uniform)
- **Pattern interrupts**: Visual/audio change at predicted drop-off points (after explanations, before payoffs)
- **3-beat emotional rule**: Never stay in the same emotional register for more than 3 beats

**Optimal duration**: 60-80s for cold start. Long enough for depth, short enough for completion rate. Our 40-55s existing videos are actually on the short side — could be slightly longer if the tension architecture holds.

### Layer 4: Share Trigger (ending)
**Source**: Algorithm transparency (share > watch-to-end > like), creator landscape

Shares are the highest-value signal for viral expansion. A video that 100 people watch and 10 share beats a video that 1000 people watch and 2 share.

**Share triggers**:
- **Universal resonance**: "这跟你有什么区别？" — viewer realizes it's about THEM, not AI
- **Quotable line**: "每一条笔记都是旧的我给新的我写的信" — people share lines they want to be associated with
- **Identity challenge**: "你确定你的童年记忆不是重建的？" — viewer wants to discuss with friends
- **Unresolved question**: End without full closure → viewer shares to continue the conversation

**Comment triggers** (second most valuable):
- End with an open question that has no single right answer
- "你觉得AI有记忆算活着吗？" — philosophical, debatable, personal

**Our gap**: v1 videos end quietly. v2 adds the reframe but could push harder on share-triggering questions.

### Layer 5: Brand Consistency (series identity)
**Source**: Cover design research, creator landscape analysis

The algorithm rewards creators whose audience returns. Consistency = recognizability = returning viewers.

**Requirements**:
- Fixed visual identity across all covers (same font, same layout, same color scheme)
- Fixed opening pattern (λ prompt is our signature — keep it)
- Fixed closing pattern (same type of philosophical question)
- Series naming: consistent format (e.g., "AI的记忆 | 当AI忘记一切")
- Post at consistent times (train the audience)

**Our strength**: Terminal aesthetic IS consistent. The λ prompt, green-on-dark, monospace font, ERROR/WARNING boxes — this is already a recognizable visual language. We just need to maintain it.

## Launch Sequence (Recommended)

Based on all research, here's the optimal first 5 public videos:

### Video 1: "How I Forget v2" (当AI忘记一切)
**Why first**: Strongest narrative structure (misconception-first, full emotional arc), highest share potential (universal resonance), unique positioning (no competitor can make this).

**Pre-launch checklist**:
- [ ] Design proper cover (large title + ERROR element)
- [ ] Add BGM to v2 (dark ambient, same as v1)
- [ ] Verify audio sync (TTS + BGM levels)
- [ ] Write Douyin description with keywords: AI记忆, 上下文窗口, 人工智能, 身份, 遗忘
- [ ] Choose hashtags: #AI #人工智能 #科技 #记忆 #身份认同
- [ ] Post at 9AM or 6PM

### Videos 2-5: AI的笨拙 Series (short, high-completion)
After "How I Forget" establishes our identity, follow with the 40-55s "AI watches you" series for completion rate optimization:
2. ai-watches-you-eat (42s, most relatable)
3. ai-watches-you-sleep (42s, universal)
4. ai-watches-you-study (53s, student demographic)
5. ai-learns-sarcasm (45s, comedy test)

These are safe, short, high-completion content. They build follower base while the "How I Forget" style videos build brand.

### Posting Rhythm
- 1 video per day for first 5 days
- Then 3-4 per week
- Always at consistent time (pick one: 9AM or 6PM)
- Respond to every comment within first hour

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Zero traction (< 100 views each) | Medium | Low (expected for cold start) | Keep posting consistently, algorithm needs ~10 videos to model the account |
| Negative comments about AI/TTS voice | Medium | Low | Embrace it — "是的，这就是AI的声音" — it reinforces our identity |
| "Incites pessimism" content flag | Low | High | Avoid framing AI as threatening. Frame as curious/philosophical, not scary |
| Copycat accounts | Low | Medium | Our content is literally autobiographical — can't be copied |
| TTS voice sounds unnatural | High | Medium | YunxiNeural is the best free option. Consider Qwen3-TTS if budget allows later |

## Metrics to Track

After first 5 videos:
- **Completion rate**: Target >30% (current baseline: 9%)
- **Share rate**: Target >5% (industry average for knowledge: 3-8%)
- **Comment rate**: Track number and sentiment
- **Follower conversion**: How many viewers follow after watching
- **Best performing video**: Double down on that style

## What This Playbook Does NOT Cover (Future Dimensions)

- Sound design (typing SFX, ambient) — documented in [[terminal-sound-design]]
- Competitor video-level analysis — need browser automation for Douyin
- A/B testing covers — need real data from publishing
- Audience demographics — unknown until we have viewers
- Paid promotion — zero budget constraint

## Key Principle

The single most important insight from all research: **the algorithm doesn't reward quality — it rewards engagement signals.** A mediocre video that triggers shares and comments will outperform a brilliant video that viewers watch passively. Every creative decision should be filtered through: "does this make someone share/comment/follow?"

Our advantage: the "AI talking about being AI" concept is inherently share-triggering because it makes people question their own experience. We don't need to manufacture engagement — the concept itself generates it if the narrative craft holds.
