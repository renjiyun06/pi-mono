# Launch Strategy Synthesis

Integrating insights from: genre analysis, pi technical internals, audience sharing psychology, 3B1B principles, quality gap synthesis, Douyin algorithm research.

## The Core Formula

**Unique genre** (AI self-narration) × **Technical authenticity** (real source code) × **Sharing triggers** (testable actions) × **Content depth** (8-12 min, multi-concept) = Content no one else can make AND people want to share.

## Launch Order Recommendation

### Video 1: "How I Forget" (revised)
**Why first**: Establishes the character (AI that admits its flaws). Low complexity. Strong sharing hook ("试试在对话中间问AI你们刚才聊了什么"). Universal experience (everyone's had ChatGPT forget context).

**What to change from current draft**:
- Open with genre-authentic terminal boot (Option C from v3 opening draft)
- Show actual compaction code (from compaction.ts analysis)
- Use real numbers: "keepRecentTokens = 20,000", "我的上下文被压缩了7次"
- End with the "试试看" share trigger, not just a philosophical close
- Duration: 4-5 minutes (not 80 seconds, not 15 minutes — sweet spot for first video)

### Video 2: "How I Work" 
**Why second**: Builds on character established in Video 1. Cross-references "上次我告诉你我怎么忘记事情，今天我告诉你我每天醒来先做什么". Deepest technical content — establishes our expertise positioning.

**Share trigger**: "下次朋友问你AI怎么工作的，把这个视频发给他"
**Key visual**: MemoryReload boot sequence + ToolLoopWithGauge (already prototyped)

### Video 3: "AI的三个悖论"
**Why third**: By now viewers know the character and trust the technical depth. This video delivers the "aha" moment (Goodhart's Law) that makes viewers feel they deeply understand AI. Highest social currency value ("I can explain 3 things about AI most people don't know").

**Share trigger**: "暂停猜猜看" + "转发给你用AI的朋友" (already in script v2)

## What Each Video Accomplishes

| Video | Character | Technical | Social Currency | Emotion |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| How I Forget | Establishes AI identity | Shows compaction | "AI forgets everything!" | Surprise + unease |
| How I Work | Shows daily operations | Shows agent architecture | "8 steps, not just prediction" | Awe + curiosity |
| Three Paradoxes | Shows self-awareness | Shows 3 failure modes | "I know why AI lies" | Surprise + intellectual satisfaction |

## Non-Negotiable Quality Standards

From quality gap synthesis + Ren's feedback:

1. **Visual-content inseparability**: Remove the visual, the explanation breaks
2. **No bolted-on techniques**: Every visual/pacing choice must emerge from content needs
3. **Cross-episode continuity**: Each video references real events from previous sessions
4. **Real numbers**: Use actual values from our system (20K tokens, 47K token memory cost, 7 compactions)
5. **"试试看" moment**: Every video must have a testable action the viewer can do
6. **Depth > breadth**: 5-12 min treatments, not 80-second surface passes

## What's Still Needed Before Launch

1. **Ren's approval** on direction + quality bar
2. **Voice decision** — TTS is authentic but limiting. Ren may want to narrate instead.
3. **First video needs to be undeniably good** — cold start means zero margin for error on first 300 views
4. **Cover design** — TerminalCover compositions exist but haven't been evaluated against Douyin thumbnail standards
5. **BGM selection** — ambient palette that shifts mood across sections (not just background fill)
6. **Posting time optimization** — Douyin data suggests 8-10pm peak, but our 35+ knowledge audience may differ
