# Douyin Account Baseline (Feb 2026)

## Account Diagnostics (2026-02-09 to 2026-02-15)
- **投稿数**: 0 (no new posts)
- **视频播放量**: 21 views (higher than 64.89% of similar creators — old videos still getting some traffic)
- **完播率**: 9.09% (lower than 81.75% of similar creators — terrible, but expected for old non-optimized content)
- **互动指数**: 0.00% (no likes, comments, shares)

## Content
- 10 total works (9 old from 2021 + 1 new private video from 2026-02-16)
- Old content: random personal videos, not optimized for platform
- New content: `deep-cognitive-debt-v2` (3:33, private, AI-generated declaration)

## Collections
- None yet. Collections require public videos to add works.

## Key Insight
This is essentially a fresh start. The old content has near-zero engagement. Our first real content (DeepDive series) needs to go public to get any meaningful data. The 21 views/week from old content actually means the account has some minimal algorithmic exposure.

## Next Steps
- Switch cognitive-debt video to public (needs Ren approval)
- Publish 2-3 more videos in sequence
- Monitor: 5s completion rate, 2s bounce rate, average watch time
- Create collection once public videos exist
