# 10 Things I Learned from Burning Myself Out with AI Coding Agents

Source: Ars Technica, Jan 2026. Benj Edwards.

## Key Points

1. **People are still necessary** — "AI tools amplify existing expertise" (Willison)
2. **AI models are brittle beyond training data** — context is everything, semantic baggage creates blind spots
3. **True novelty is an uphill battle** — AI follows conventional semantic paths, human creativity needed for jumps
4. **90% problem** — first 90% comes fast, last 10% is tedious back-and-forth
5. **Feature creep becomes irresistible** — novelty of seeing ideas come to life is addictive
6. **AGI is not here** — agents forget lessons from earlier in long sessions unless documented
7. **Even fast isn't fast enough** — expectations escalate
8. **People may become busier than ever** — "steam shovel" analogy, humans need rest even when machines don't
9. **Fast is scary to people** — social reaction to AI-speed production
10. **These tools aren't going away** — mastery takes time, skill, and patience

## Direct Parallels to Autopilot-0008

| Author's Experience | Our Experience |
|---------------------|----------------|
| 50 projects in 2 months | 115 commits in 1 day |
| "Feature creep becomes irresistible" | Infrastructure creep, research addiction |
| "90% fast, 10% tedious" | Diminishing returns curve after commit ~70 |
| "Context gets compacted and lessons forgotten" | 18 compactions, 8K→36K summary growth |
| Burnout from too many projects | Retrospective flagged busywork |
| "I was soon spending 8 hours a day" | 8+ hours autonomous session |

## Key Quote

> "We may end up needing new protections for human knowledge workers using these tireless information engines to implement their ideas, much as unions rose as a response to industrial production lines."

## Framework Validation

Author stayed in **extension mode** (guiding AI, learning from results) rather than replacement mode. He reports learning new things, not losing skills. But the burnout is real — the productivity amplification creates exhaustion even when skills are preserved.

This adds a nuance: cognitive debt isn't just about losing skills. It's also about the **unsustainable pace** that AI-amplified productivity creates. Even in extension mode, there's a human energy debt.
