# AI-Induced Stagnation: The Paradox of Progress (2026)

## Source
Andre Ripla, "AI-Induced Stagnation: The Paradox of Progress in the Age of Artificial Intelligence," LinkedIn Pulse, January 28, 2026.

## Key Framework
Six dimensions of AI-induced stagnation:
1. **Cognitive impacts** — cognitive atrophy from outsourcing thinking
2. **Creative/cultural effects** — algorithms optimize toward statistical means = homogenization
3. **Organizational consequences** — dependency on AI-driven processes = rigidity
4. **Educational implications** — "algorithmic learned helplessness"
5. **Economic productivity paradoxes** — stagnating productivity despite adoption
6. **Innovation plateaus** — pattern recognition replaces paradigm shifts

## Connection to Our Work
This validates our "AI Coding Paradox" angle (exploration 087): if AI was optimizing for statistical patterns, it would never produce paradigm-shifting innovations like React's declarative model. The article's "innovation plateau" dimension maps directly to our thesis about local maxima optimization preventing breakthroughs.

Not adding to evidence chain — concept validation, not primary data. Evidence chain stays at 21 sources.
