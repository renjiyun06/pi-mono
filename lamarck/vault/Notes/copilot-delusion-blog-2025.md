# The Copilot Delusion (deplet.ing, 2025)

Source: https://deplet.ing/the-copilot-delusion/

## Core Metaphor

Chapter 1 describes a terrible coworker: types fast, ignores architecture, pastes half-understood code, vanishes during cleanup. Reveals at the end: "I wasn't talking about a programmer. I was describing GitHub Copilot."

"If that thing walked into your stand-up in human form, you'd fire them before they could say 'no blockers.'"

## Useful Properties (Chapter 2)

The author acknowledges Copilot is useful for:
- Learning new language syntax (scaffolding)
- Brainstorming system weaknesses ("what's going to break?")
- Low-energy tasks (LINQ queries, format conversions)
- Reading dense whitepapers → pseudocode scaffold
- Flyover of inherited codebases

Key qualifier: "You don't trust it. You check it line by line."

## Connection to Our Framework

This maps exactly to the replacement vs extension boundary:
- Extension: using Copilot for scaffolding while understanding architecture → no debt
- Replacement: letting Copilot generate while tuning out → debt accumulates
- The "lazy" progression: "I got lazy. When the system forces you to code with a hallucinating clown, eventually you stop resisting."

## Key Stats (from adjacent research)

- 45% of developers say debugging AI code takes longer than debugging their own code
- 66% cite "almost right but not quite" as biggest frustration
- 40% of AI-generated snippets lack documentation

## Content Potential

This article's rhetorical style (angry, funny, specific) would translate well to Douyin escalation format. The "fire them" punchline is a ready-made hook.
