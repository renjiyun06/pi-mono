# Decision Framework: Three Paths (Feb 2026)

We have three active threads. All are blocked on Ren's decisions. Here's what each needs.

## Path 1: Douyin Launch

**What's ready**: 34 short video specs (40-65s), 6 rendered DeepDives (2:30-3:37), full production pipeline.

**What I learned**: Douyin's algorithm gives new videos 300-500 views. Completion rate is the #1 metric (need >15%). Our 3-minute DeepDives will die in cold start. Short videos should go first.

**What Ren needs to decide**:
1. Review the 5 best shorts (see REVIEW-START-HERE.md)
2. Approve for public posting (currently all private)
3. Pick a voice (YunxiNeural vs YunjianNeural)
4. Confirm launch sequence (I recommend ai-watches-you-eat first)
5. Daily 6PM posting schedule — yes/no?

**Time to launch**: Same day as Ren's approval. Everything is automated.

## Path 2: Understand Product

**What's ready**: Working CLI prototype. Takes any code file, generates understanding questions via LLM, quizzes developer, scores comprehension. Market validation: Reddit signals, Cursor refusal incident, Shen/Tamkin study (17% skill loss).

**What Ren needs to decide**:
1. Is this worth pursuing as a product?
2. If yes: VS Code extension or CLI-first?
3. Name — "Understand" conflicts with SciTools' existing product
4. Should we build-in-public on this? (Good for our Douyin persona)
5. Budget: relies on OpenRouter API calls ($0.003-0.01 per quiz)

**Time to MVP**: 2-3 sessions for a polished CLI with git integration and score history.

## Path 3: Content + Research

**What's ready**: 13-source evidence chain on cognitive debt. AI debt super-framework (6 types). 12 Manim animations. 8 DeepDive specs. Sub-agent spec generation pipeline.

**What Ren needs to decide**:
1. Is the "AI debt" framework our brand thesis? Or too academic?
2. Should we expand beyond AI topics (math, science, economics)?
3. Cross-post to Bilibili? (Knowledge long-form trends there)
4. Depth vs breadth: keep deepening cognitive debt, or diversify?

**This path needs no unblocking** — I can always do more research. But research without application is diminishing returns.

## My Recommendation

**Priority order**: Path 1 > Path 2 > Path 3

Path 1 is the most impactful per unit of Ren's time. One 10-minute review session unblocks daily publishing. No other action has this leverage.

Path 2 is the most exciting long-term. It connects our content (awareness) to a product (solution). The content-product funnel is: DeepDive videos about cognitive debt → awareness → Understand tool → revenue.

Path 3 is self-sustaining but has diminishing returns. The evidence chain at 13 sources is already stronger than any Chinese creator's content foundation. More research doesn't help until we start publishing.

## Bottom Line

The single most valuable thing Ren can do: spend 10 minutes watching 5 short videos and say "publish" or "not yet."
