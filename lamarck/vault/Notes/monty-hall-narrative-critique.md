# Monty Hall — Narrative Critique

## Current Structure

```
Scene 1: Setup — here's the problem (0-8s)
Scene 2: Host opens door (8-15s)
Scene 3: "Most people think 50/50" pause (15-19s)
Scene 4: Math explanation (19-31s)
Scene 5: 100-door intuition pump (31-46s)
Scene 6: Moral — "trust math not intuition" (46-51s)
```

## What Works
- Clean, correct explanation
- 100-door intuition pump is genuinely effective
- Pacing is decent (short scenes)
- Manim animations are clear

## What's Missing

### 1. No Emotional Hook
Opens with "有一个数学问题" — purely intellectual framing. No emotional stakes, no reason to care. Compare to: "你答错了这道题。别担心，全世界最聪明的数学家也答错了。" Now the viewer is thinking "wait, I would have gotten it right" — which is EXACTLY the misconception that makes this problem interesting.

### 2. No Misconception Commitment
The video mentions "大多数人觉得五五开" but doesn't COMMIT the viewer to the wrong answer first. Should actively get the viewer to think "obviously don't switch" before revealing they're wrong. Veritasium principle: the viewer needs to FEEL the cognitive conflict, not just be told that other people experience it.

Better: "你会换吗？先想一下。[pause] 大部分人——包括很多数学教授——说不换。[pause] 他们全错了。"

### 3. Linear Information Dump
The math explanation in Scene 4 is a classic "front-loaded value dump" — all the logic in one continuous 12-second explanation. No answer+question rhythm.

Better:
- "你选门一。概率三分之一。" (OK, then what?)
- "但剩下三分之二在哪？" (Good question...)
- "在门二和门三。" (Right, so?)
- "主持人开了门三。那三分之二去了哪？" (Oh...)
- "全在门二。" (!!!)

Each step answers one question while raising the next.

### 4. No Micro-Tension
Everything proceeds smoothly. The viewer is a passive listener. No sense of "what if the math doesn't work out?"

Fix: "如果我们的直觉是对的呢？那数学就应该给出50/50。我们来看看..." → Now the viewer is TESTING a hypothesis, not receiving a lecture.

### 5. No Pattern Interrupts
Visually monotonous — Manim animations at constant pace. Need visual punctuation: sudden color changes when the probability shifts, a "wrong answer" flash before the correct reveal, the moment the 98 doors open should be DRAMATIC (fast sequence, sound cue).

### 6. Weak Ending
"直觉不一定靠谱" — generic moral. Doesn't create any desire to share or comment.

Better endings:
- "现在你知道了。下次有人跟你玩三扇门游戏... 换。" (actionable + conversational)
- "这道题之所以著名，不是因为答案难。而是因为即使你看完了证明，你的大脑还是在说：不对。" (meta-cognitive — the viewer reflects on their own resistance)
- End with a question: "你被说服了吗？还是你的直觉仍然在说不用换？" (comment bait)

## Recommended Rewrite (Expectation → Twist → Reframe)

**Expectation (0-8s)**: "三扇门，一扇有车。你选了一扇。主持人打开了一扇空门。换不换？[pause] 你心里已经有答案了吧。"

**Twist (8-18s)**: "大部分人——包括1000个博士——说不换。[beat] 他们全错了。换门，赢的概率翻倍。" Now the viewer is hooked: "Wait, that can't be right."

**Quest to understand (18-35s)**: "听起来不可能？我们来测试一下你的直觉。" → Build the probability step by step using answer+question rhythm. Each step is a CHALLENGE to the viewer's intuition, not a lecture.

**100-door escalation (35-45s)**: "还不信？把3扇门变成100扇。" → Visual escalation. This is the "proof" beat.

**Reframe (45-55s)**: "这道题的意义不在概率。在于：你的大脑会用'感觉对'来代替'算出来对'。每一天，你都在做这种替换。" → The payoff isn't about doors. It's about how YOUR brain lies to you.

## Key Difference

Current version: educational explanation of a math problem.
Improved version: a **challenge to the viewer's intelligence** that they can't walk away from, ending with a revelation about how their own mind works.
