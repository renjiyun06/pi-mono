# Developers Say AI Coding Tools Work — And That's What Worries Them (Ars Technica, Jan 2026)

## Best Quotes (content-ready)

**Darren Mart (Microsoft, 18 years)**:
> "I'm only comfortable using them for completing tasks that I already fully understand. Otherwise there's no way to know if I'm being led down a perilous path and setting myself up for a mountain of future debt."

**Darren Mart on the role shift**:
> "The software development role is abruptly pivoting from creation/construction to supervision. And while some may welcome that pivot, others certainly do not. I'm firmly in the latter category."

**David Hagerty (POS systems)**:
> "It's going to get harder for junior-level positions to get filled when I can get junior-quality code for less than minimum wage using a model like Sonnet 4.5."

**Roland Dreier (Linux kernel contributor)**:
> "There are going to have to be changes to education and training to get junior developers the experience and judgment they need, when it's just a waste to make them implement small pieces of a system like I came up doing."

**Nike engineer Brian Westby**:
> "Hallucinations are still too prevalent if I give it too much room to work." (50/50 good/bad assessment)

**Tim Kellogg (agent builder)**:
> "Yes, massively so. Today it's the act of writing code, then it'll be architecture, then it'll be tiers of product management. Those who can't adapt to operate at a higher level won't keep their jobs."

## Key Themes

1. **The competence paradox**: Works best for people who already understand what they're building; dangerous for those who don't
2. **Creation → Supervision shift**: Developers becoming reviewers, not writers. Some hate this.
3. **Junior pipeline crisis**: Multiple developers independently flag the apprenticeship destruction
4. **Legacy code lifeline**: AI is genuinely useful for archaeology of undocumented old codebases
5. **Enterprise gap**: Executives demand "AI orientation" but good tools require legal overhead; employees get "crappy AI tools"

## Connection to Our Work

- Mart's "only comfortable when I already understand" = the core Understand product thesis
- Junior pipeline quotes reinforce talent pipeline debt (exploration 069)
- "Creation to supervision" shift = cognitive debt in real time — losing the practice that builds skill
- Multiple independent professionals describing the same debt pattern we document in 15 studies
