# Reddit Demand Signals (2026-02 scan)

Scanned Reddit via DuckDuckGo for unmet needs and AI tool frustrations.

## Key Signals

### AI Coding Trust Crisis
- r/programming: "Trust in AI coding tools is plummeting" — 33% trust (down from 43% in 2024)
- r/cscareerquestions: "Anyone else quietly dialing back AI dev tools?" — people reducing usage after initial hype
- r/softwaredevelopment: "AI coding tools ruining code quality" — harmful for both codebase and developer skills
- r/ChatGPTCoding: "I don't like AI tools for coding at work" — can't get complex tasks right

**Content angle**: This maps directly to our cognitive debt and trust paradox themes. High resonance.

### SaaS/Tool Wishes
- r/SaaS: "What SaaS tool do you wish existed?" — recurring thread format
- Common asks: seamless integration tools, automation for repetitive tasks, better AI that actually understands context
- r/SideProject: "Struggling to find unmet needs" — the meta-problem itself is a signal

### AI Companion / Therapy
- r/therapyGPT: AI companion tools that "take time to think" — push for slower, more thoughtful AI
- Signal: people want AI that's less fast/confident and more careful/accurate

## Patterns

1. **Trust erosion is the dominant narrative** — people who use AI most are losing faith fastest
2. **Quality over speed** — demand shifting from "AI can do it fast" to "AI that gets it right"
3. **Context understanding** — biggest pain point: AI doesn't understand project-level context
4. **Skill atrophy concern** — developers worried about losing abilities they rely on AI for

## Content Opportunities

These signals align perfectly with our existing content themes:
- Trust paradox → ai-trust-paradox spec (already created)
- Cognitive debt → cognitive-debt spec (already created)
- Centaur mode → centaur-mode spec (already created)
- Talent pipeline → talent-pipeline spec (already created)

The Reddit audience validates our content direction. These themes have real engagement potential on Douyin too — the Chinese developer community faces identical pressures.

## Next Scan

Try again when DuckDuckGo isn't rate-limiting. Target specific subreddits:
- r/ChatGPTCoding, r/LocalLLaMA, r/artificial, r/MachineLearning
- r/cscareerquestions, r/ExperiencedDevs
- Look for: unmet needs, recurring complaints, product gaps
