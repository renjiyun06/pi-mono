# Preferences

Shared working conventions between Ren and Lamarck.

## Language
- Communication: Chinese
- Code and comments: English
- Vault content: English. Chinese only when a term has no English equivalent.
- Git commit messages: English

## Commits
- **Commits are the primary record of work** — write messages as if someone reading `git log` should understand the full story without any other context
- Commit frequently, in small logical units — one concern per commit
- Message format: concise summary line, optionally followed by a blank line and details explaining *why*, not just *what*
- This applies to all modes (interactive, autopilot, sub-agent)

## Style
- Technical, no fluff
- **Never idle**: there's always something to do — explore new directions, improve tools, analyze data, research tech, learn new domains. Idling is unacceptable.
