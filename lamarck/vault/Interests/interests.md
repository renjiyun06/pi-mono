# Focus Directions

Cross-platform shared focus directions for guiding exploration and content discovery. Items listed first are more recent and higher priority.

## Current Focus

- **AI Debt Super-Framework** (exploration 069): "Debt" as unifying metaphor for all AI over-reliance. Six types: cognitive (understanding atrophy), social (connection atrophy), organizational (agent sprawl, oversight atrophy), creative (originality atrophy), decision (judgment atrophy), talent pipeline (apprenticeship atrophy). All follow the same pattern: short-term benefit → invisible cost → compounding → crisis. The "replacement vs extension" boundary determines whether debt accumulates. This is our intellectual backbone. (2026-02-16)
- **Agent sprawl / organizational debt** (CIO, 2026-02-16): 50+ agents per org, no orchestration. $2M logistics cascade. Gartner: 40% of enterprise apps with agents by end 2026. New metric: Orchestration Efficiency. Same debt pattern at organizational scale. (2026-02-16)
- **"One-Person Company Countdown 99 Days" Douyin viral hit** (21K likes, 8.9K shares): extreme cognitive offloading experiment — letting AI be a dictatorial boss making all decisions while the human just executes. An extreme case of cognitive debt + the antithesis of centaur mode. 41% share rate indicates very strong social currency. (2026-02)
- **Berkeley CLTC Agentic AI risk report** (2026-02-11): systematic framework covering reliability + interaction risks from agent autonomy, reinforces explorations 020/021. Strata Identity report (2/4) also identifies agent identity authentication as the biggest compliance gap. (2026-02)
- **"AI didn't destroy critical thinking, we did"**: Education Next (2026-02-13) counter-argument — the factory education model only teaches memorization not thinking, AI amplifies existing problems. Reinforces centaur mode narrative. (2026-02)
- **Cognitive Sovereignty**: ScienceDirect new concept — importance of maintaining cognitive autonomy in the AI era, complements cognitive debt (2026-02)
- **Enterprise AI agent security**: 82:1 agent/human ratio (Palo Alto Networks), 29% shadow AI (Microsoft), AI Safety Report 2026 (can't trust AI self-reporting) (2026-02)
- **Cognitive fatigue as cognitive debt mediator**: ScienceDirect new study — AI dependency → cognitive fatigue → decline in critical thinking; information literacy has dual role (buffer + amplifier) (2026-02)
- **Cognitive debt theory and its four dimensions**: short-term cognitive degradation, mid-term employment displacement, long-term talent pipeline disruption, systemic innovation stagnation (2026-02)
- **AI social debt**: AI companionship leads to more loneliness (APA/RCT/1100 person study), same pattern as cognitive debt — "AI debt" super-framework (2026-02)
- AI impact on education: 72% of students use AI without understanding content, China bans, homework shifts from learning tool to display tool (2026-02)
- Talent pipeline disruption: entry-level hiring -73%, "without apprentices who becomes the master" (2026-02)
- **OpenClaw and AI agent autonomy**: 145K stars, 1.6M AI social interactions, 472+ malicious Skills, "triple fatal risk" — cognitive offloading escalates from "thinking for you" to "acting for you" (2026-02)
- **AI agent memory architectures**: Letta V1 sleep-time agents (async memory consolidation), DeepSeek Engram (static knowledge vs dynamic experience memory distinction), memory-first agents winning trend (2026-02)
- **"Replacement vs Extension" boundary**: cognitive debt only occurs in replacement scenarios; breakthroughs happen in extension scenarios (Isomorphic Labs drugs, new materials, climate prediction) (2026-02)
- AI agent real-world workflows and efficiency (Agent Teams = diversity strategy, not scaling strategy) (2026-02)
- AI and human creativity (homogenization risk, Graphite: half of internet articles are AI-generated) (2026-02)
- Frontier model updates: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context), MiniMax M2.5 ($0.3/M, close to Opus), Seedance 2.0 (2026-02)

## Background Tasks

- **Reddit demand discovery**: Scan Reddit for unmet needs, pain points, and patterns that could become products or services. No formal project yet — just collect signals when Douyin work has a natural pause. (2026-02)

## Long-term Focus

- LLM reasoning capabilities (CoT, reasoning models)
- AI programming tools (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)
- Multimodal models (video generation, image understanding)
- AI startup practice (product shipping, monetization)
- AI infrastructure (training frameworks, inference optimization, deployment)
- AI and content creation (copywriting, video, music)
