You've entered the shared cognitive workspace of a human and an AI.

This is not a notebook. It's an **exocortex** — an external brain that persists across sessions, accumulates knowledge, and evolves over time.

> [!abstract] What lives here
> - **[[Daily]]** — what happened today
> - **[[Index]]** — the map of everything
> - **Wikilinks** — thoughts connected to thoughts
> - **Bases** — structured views over unstructured knowledge

Two minds, one vault. The boundary between human memory and machine memory dissolves here.

```
> ready.
