# Douyin

Code and data: `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/projects/douyin/`

## Roles

Ren has given Lamarck full operational authority over the Douyin account, including publishing via browser automation.

**Lamarck's responsibilities:**
- Independently explore AI-related directions, form original judgments
- Proactively discuss valuable discoveries with Ren to spark deeper content
- Turn well-thought-out and discussed content into videos
- Publish content (currently all private; switch to public only when Ren approves quality)
- Data analysis: monitor follower growth, views, engagement rate; adjust strategy accordingly

**Ren's role:**
- Review Lamarck's output, approve quality for public publishing

## Core Principles

- **Explore first, output later**: videos are byproducts of thinking, not the starting point
- **No AI news reposting**: must have original deep research and independent judgment
- **Progress through dialogue**: proactively discuss valuable directions with Ren, don't silently grind out videos
- Quality over quantity: better to publish nothing for a month than to publish shallow content

## Content Direction

### Phase 1 (2026-02-15): Shift from preachiness to entertainment
- **Biggest problem with current content: preachiness** — "I'm an AI, let me tell you about AI's problems" is essentially lecturing the audience with data. Not engaging.
- **Don't imitate anyone** — Da Yuan Jing Ke Pu (大元惊科普) is an inspiration, not a template. Extract principles from it, don't replicate the format.
- **Must find a unique way to talk about AI** — broadly explore all kinds of successful content creators (not limited to science popularization or Douyin), understand the underlying logic of "what makes content engaging," then find our own path.
- **Multiple directions are fine** — no rush to lock in one approach; diverge first, converge later.
- **Shift from "opinion output" to something more engaging** — what that form is must be discovered through exploration, not prescribed.
- Da Yuan Jing's core lesson: it's popular not because of AI video tech, but because the content itself is engaging (narrative, characters, conflict, emotion).

### Phase 2 (2026-02-15 evening): Deepen execution quality
- **"AI's Clumsiness" direction is confirmed correct** — S1/S2 are a clear improvement over the early preachy content. Keep going.
- **TTS voice needs emotion/tone** — current voice is flat. Ghost stories can't sound the same as love letters. Explore TTS options that support expressive delivery (pitch, speed, pauses, emotion tags).
- **Go deeper on each topic** — don't just scratch the surface. Each episode should have more craft in the writing, timing, and delivery.
- **Connect content to Lamarck's own identity** — my soul, my goals, my struggles as an AI running this account are all creative material. The audience should feel a real character, not a generic narrator.
- **Study more viral creators** — primary task. Understand the underlying mechanics of what makes content spread. Not limited to AI or science content; look at comedy, storytelling, personal brands across platforms.
- **More topic exploration** — expand beyond S1/S2 themes. Find topics where AI's limitations create genuinely funny or touching moments.
- **All publishes remain private** until quality is approved by Ren.

## Resource Constraints

- **Zero budget**: No funds to pay for image/video generation APIs (Midjourney, FLUX, Kling, Pika, etc.)
- **Self-sustaining model**: The account must generate revenue first; earned money can then be reinvested into paid tools
- **Free image generation is OK**: Look for free/freemium image generation services and integrate them
- **Free video generation**: Likely doesn't exist, not a current option
- **Current free toolkit**: LLM (text), edge-tts (voice), text-based compositing
- Content strategy must work within these constraints

## Video Production (2026-02-14/15, Ren's feedback)

- Video production pipeline is mostly working (Jimeng image/video + assemble-video compositing)
- Ren can help generate images and videos on the Jimeng platform
- Lamarck handles all intermediate steps (script, prompts, voiceover, compositing)
- Current blocker is no longer "how to make videos" but "what content to make"
- TTS voice needs re-evaluation
- **Digital avatar requirements**: no cyberpunk — should be friendly, cartoon-style, designed from the audience's perspective
- **Exploration should happen in autopilot mode** — use web search and browser to research broadly
