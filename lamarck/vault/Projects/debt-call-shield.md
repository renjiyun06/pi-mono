# Debt Call Shield

Code: `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/projects/debt-call-shield/`

## Overview

A mobile app for people in debt. Core features:
- Auto-identify and intercept/answer debt collection calls
- AI answers calls, has real-time voice conversation with collectors
- Anti-scam feature (identifies scam calls)

Compliance positioning: **Smart incoming call protection / anti-harassment app** — never marketed as "helping evade debt collection."

## Status

Phase 1 in progress: full AI pipeline implemented, waiting for Twilio account and API key to resume end-to-end testing.

See project README for detailed architecture, completed work, and blockers.
