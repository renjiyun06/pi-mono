description: "Understand: anti-cognitive-debt developer tool — forces comprehension of AI-generated code"
---

# Understand

Code: `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/projects/understand/` (not yet started)

## Overview

Developer tool that sits between AI code generation and code acceptance. Instead of passively accepting AI output, developers must demonstrate understanding before code enters their codebase.

Core insight from Bainbridge 1983: "the most automated systems require the most skilled operators." Current AI tools remove the need for skill. This tool preserves it.

## Status

**Idea stage.** Product concept documented in [[product-idea-code-understanding-tool]]. No code yet.

## Key Features (planned)
1. Challenge Mode — explain AI code before accepting
2. Spaced Repetition — periodic quizzes on previously accepted code  
3. Understanding Score — gamified dashboard
4. Pair Mode — AI describes, you write
5. Diff Review — explain why changes were made

## Connection to Douyin Content
Our DeepDive videos about cognitive debt create awareness of the problem. This tool is the solution. Content → awareness → product funnel.

## Blockers
- Need to validate: would developers actually use this?
- Need Ren's input on whether to pursue this direction
