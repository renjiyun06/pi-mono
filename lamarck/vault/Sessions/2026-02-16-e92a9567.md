## Last Compaction Summary




## Goal
Build longer-form video content (2-5 minutes) for Douyin using Remotion + Manim + edge-tts, expanding beyond AI topics. Phase 3: deeper explainer content with advanced visual composition. Apply active learning — study reference material from top creators before producing. Additionally, exploring "Understand" product concept — an anti-cognitive-debt developer tool. Testing new "escalation ladder" rapid-fire format optimized for shares/virality. Content-as-marketing: use escalation videos to promote Understand product. Sleep-time compute: building infrastructure for autonomous background processing between sessions.

## Constraints & Preferences
- Zero budget — no paid image/video generation APIs
- All content in Chinese, vault notes in English
- Autopilot mode on branch `autopilot-0008`
- Never idle; never commit data files from tasks
- Ren's review of existing 34 short specs still pending (REVIEW-START-HERE.md)
- Tools available: Remotion (motion graphics), Manim (math animation), edge-tts (TTS), no live action
- **No for-loops in autopilot** — validate a technique once/twice, then move to next frontier. Batch application of proven methods is task work for lower-spec models, not exploration.
- **Never do repetitive labor** — whether interacting with Ren or exploring autonomously, repetitive application is grunt work to delegate to tasks.
- **Private videos cannot be added to Douyin collections** — collections require public videos
- **Chinese search queries fail on DuckDuckGo** — English queries return generic results for Douyin-specific research

## Progress
### Done
- [x] Context restored from vault (8 priority-high notes, daily notes, git log)
- [x] Studied Remotion Agent Skills: transitions, text-animations, sequencing, charts, animations, timing, audio
- [x] Installed `@remotion/transitions`, `@remotion/paths`, `@remotion/renderer`, `@remotion/media` in remotion-video project

### In Progress
- [ ] **Adding `debt` command to `understand.ts` CLI** — analyzes git log to identify AI-assisted commits and show files with understanding debt (unreviewed AI changes). Usage docs updated with `--since <ref>` flag but actual implementation not yet written
- [ ] **Advancing Understand CLI prototype**: Adding score persistence (`.understand/history.json`) and summary mode (`understand summary`) to track understanding scores over time. Already edited file header/imports in `understand.ts`
- [ ] **Processing Eisele article findings** — potential evidence chain source #15, Understand product validation material, or new DeepDive topic
- [ ] **Reading Springer "How AI is rewiring the human brain" paper** — generational cognitive divergence, epistemic sovereignty
- [ ] Rendering `deep-birthday-paradox-v3.mp4` (render started but was aborted mid-way)
- [ ] Rendering `deep-one-percent.json` (not yet attempted)

### Blocked
- Ren's review of existing 34 short video specs and first publish approval still pending
- Douyin collections require public videos — can't organize content until videos are published

## Key Decisions
- **DeepDive composition over TransitionSeries**: Used Sequence-based scene switching with per-scene backgrounds
- **Non-AI content expansion**: Birthday Paradox and 1% myth chosen as proof-of-concept
- **Scene type system**: 7→8 types (chapter/text/data/quote/code/comparison/visual/timeline)
- **Chinese quotes in JSON**: Use `「」` not `""` to avoid JSON parsing errors
- **Visual storytelling checklist (from 3B1B study)**: Single running example, visual per section, progressive build, concrete→abstract, one concept per visual, scale reveal as climax, honest simplification
- **No for-loops in autopilot**: Validate technique once/twice → move to next frontier
- **Self-evaluation before new production**: Critically evaluate rendered output quality before continuing
- **Line-by-line text reveal over static cards**: Spring-animated staggered reveal
- **Subtitle overlay for all scenes**: Douyin-style semi-transparent bar at bottom
- **BGM at 6% volume**: Subtle ambient background music with fade-out
- **SceneFade dissolve-through-dark**: 5-frame fade-in/out per scene
- **Section indicator in top-left**: Persistent chip showing section number and chapter name
- **Uncontested niche identified**: No Chinese creator combines Manim + AI explainers
- **Depth over breadth**: Go deep into one capability rather than surveying many
- **Sub-agent delegation for spec generation**: Task template `generate-deepdive.md` enables delegating spec writing with quality checklist
- **AI Debt Super-Framework**: Unifying lens across 6 debt types — replacement vs extension boundary
- **Intellectual synthesis mode**: When blocked on production, shift to research synthesis and framework building
- **Bainbridge as historical anchor**: 1983 paper validates AI debt framework with 43 years of hindsight
- **"Understand" product concept**: Anti-cognitive-debt tool forcing comprehension of AI-generated code — identified uncontested market niche
- **Pivot to neuroscience research**: When blocked on Ren's review, deepen content foundation with cognitive offloading literature
- **BGM path was correct**: Original `render-with-voice.ts` code was correct, reverted fix attempt
- **Diminishing returns on production**: 6 rendered DeepDives is enough — primary blocker is Ren's review
- **Cold-start strategy**: First 10 published videos should be short specs (38-65s) optimized for completion rate; DeepDives come in phase 3-4
- **Launch sequence**: Start with `ai-watches-you-eat` (38s, most relatable)
- **Escalation ladder format**: Rapid-fire escalation (HOOK → PROOF → ESCALATION ×3-4 → REFRAME) is the share-optimized format
- **BGM path for specs**: Needs `../bgm/` relative path from specs/ directory
- **Particle field background**: Opt-in visual enhancement (`particles: true`) to combat "text on black" monotony
- **Retrospective honesty**: Exploration 074 identified research collection addiction — need to ship rather than collect more sources
- **Understand prototype advancement chosen over more research**: After retrospective, decided to add concrete features (score persistence, summary mode) rather than continue evidence gathering
- **Understand pi extension as integration path**: Built extension to track file modifications during coding sessions, enabling in-context `/understand` command
- **Content-as-marketing for Understand**: Created escalation-cognitive-debt-tool spec as a video that promotes the Understand product using our own autopilot data (26 unquizzed files) as proof
- **Defensive text access in DeepDive**: Chapter scenes now use `text || chapterTitle || ""` fallback chain to prevent crashes
- **Silence for empty narration**: Pipeline generates 2s silence via ffmpeg anullsrc instead of crashing on empty TTS text
- **Sleep-time compute as infrastructure direction**: When all projects blocked on Ren's review, building session consolidation tooling is genuinely novel infrastructure work (not research collection)

## Next Steps
1. **Complete `debt` command implementation** in `understand.ts` CLI — git log analysis for AI-assisted commits with understanding debt tracking
2. **Complete Understand CLI enhancements** — finish score persistence (`.understand/history.json`) and summary mode (`understand summary`)
3. **Expand sleep-time compute** — build additional consolidation/analysis tools that run between sessions
4. **Await Ren's direction** on three paths: Douyin launch, Understand product, or Research
5. **Process Eisele article findings** — decide: add to evidence chain (#15), use for Understand validation, or create new DeepDive spec
6. **Check sub-agent output** for "AI rewiring brain" DeepDive spec — review and render if ready
7. **Finish reading Springer paper** on generational cognitive divergence and epistemic sovereignty
8. **Render remaining specs**: `deep-birthday-paradox-v3`, `deep-one-percent` with all improvements
9. Explore new frontiers — next wave of improvements or new content types
10. Continue Chinese-language reference study (deeper analysis of specific Douyin/Bilibili creators)
11. Develop AI debt super-framework into more DeepDive specs — rich topic with 16+ source evidence chain

- **Neuroscience research**: Key findings — 17% skill reduction (Shen & Tamkin), BCM theory/System 0/3R Principle (Nature), epistemic sovereignty/generational divergence (Springer)
- **Chinese search limitation**: DuckDuckGo fails on Chinese queries
- **Eisele article key data points**: DORA delivery stability drops with AI adoption; GitClear code duplication surge + refactoring collapse; Productivity J-Curve; shift from "vibe coding" to "forensic engineering"
- **Berkeley CLTC report**: L0-L5 autonomy levels for AI agents, cascading hallucinations, deceptive alignment, guardian agents
- **CodeRabbit study**: AI creates 1.7x more bugs, 75% more logic errors, 3x readability issues, 8x performance issues (470 GitHub repos)
- **Retrospective finding (exploration 074)**: Research collection addiction identified as main inefficiency — need to ship rather than collect more sources
- **Pi extension API**: `types.ts` at `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts` — available hooks include `tool_result` events, command registration, file tracking
- **Pipeline bugs fixed this segment**: (1) `DeepDive.tsx` line 1329 crashed on `sections[i].text.replace()` when text undefined on chapter scenes — fixed with `text || chapterTitle || ""` fallback; (2) `render-with-voice.ts` crashed when narration was empty/undefined — edge-tts produced 0-byte MP3 → ffprobe failure; fixed by generating 2s silence via `ffmpeg -f lavfi -i anullsrc`
- **Sleep-time compute**: `session-consolidate.ts` at `lamarck/tasks/session-consolidate.ts` — reads pi JSONL session files, extracts compaction summaries, generates vault digests. First output: `vault/Sessions/2026-02-16-e92a9567.md`. Pi session files at `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` in JSONL format.

**Turn Context (split turn):**

## Original Request
The user asked to restore context by reading the vault Index.md and following its "Context Restore" guidelines after a context compaction.

## Early Progress
- Read all 8 priority:high vault notes (edge-tts, TTS calibration, task system, web search alternatives, extensions, WSL port forwarding, playwright, browser automation)
- Read recent git log (25 commits) — on branch `autopilot-0008` at commit `c90794aa` (100 commits)
- Read daily note 2026-02-16 (massive — 17 segments of autonomous work)
- Read autopilot.md rules (branch check, no idle, no for-loops, no data file commits)
- Read interests.md for current focus directions
- Read full pi compaction source code (`compaction.ts` ~810 lines, `utils.ts` ~155 lines)
- Read understand.ts CLI (631 lines — complete with debt, summary, quiz, dry-run)
- Read understand extension and design-pi-integration doc

## Key decisions and work done:
- **Exploration 078**: Wrote concrete proposal for fixing compaction summary growth (UPDATE_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT needs token budget)
- **Updated AUTOPILOT-0008-SUMMARY.md**: Now shows 4 deliverables (added sleep-time compute v0), 101 commits
- **Updated daily note**: Added segment 17 documentation
- **session-consolidate.ts enhancement**: Added first compaction summary as collapsible details section
- **git-hook-understand.sh**: Created non-blocking prepare-commit-msg hook warning about unquizzed files
- Assessed Understand CLI was actually complete (not "in progress" as earlier summary suggested)
- Branch reached 103 commits

## Context for Suffix
- On branch `autopilot-0008`, 103 commits, all pushed to origin
- Autopilot rules: no for-loops (validate once then move on), never idle, no data file commits
- Retrospective (exploration 074) warned about diminishing returns after commit ~80 and research collection traps
- All major deliverables documented and complete; Ren's decisions needed for next direction (publish? understand product direction? pi contributions?)
- gh CLI not authenticated (known issue)
- Was exploring free image generation APIs as the latest frontier attempt

## First Compaction Summary

<details>
<summary>Compaction #1 (8,240 chars — earliest preserved context)</summary>




## Goal
Build longer-form video content (2-5 minutes) for Douyin using Remotion + Manim + edge-tts, expanding beyond AI topics. This is "Phase 3" of the content direction, shifting from 40-65s short specs to deeper explainer content with advanced visual composition.

## Constraints & Preferences
- Zero budget — no paid image/video generation APIs
- All content in Chinese, vault notes in English
- Autopilot mode on branch `autopilot-0008` (no commits yet)
- Never idle; never commit data files from tasks
- Ren's review of existing 34 short specs still pending (REVIEW-START-HERE.md)
- Tools available: Remotion (motion graphics), Manim (math animation), edge-tts (TTS), no live action

## Progress
### Done
- [x] Context restored from vault (8 priority-high notes, daily notes, git log)
- [x] Studied Remotion Agent Skills: transitions, text-animations, sequencing, charts, animations, timing, audio
- [x] Installed `@remotion/transitions`, `@remotion/paths`, `@remotion/renderer` in `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/projects/douyin/tools/remotion-video/`
- [x] Built new `DeepDive` composition (`src/DeepDive.tsx`) with 6 scene types: chapter, text, data, quote, code, comparison — plus progress bar, vignette, glass-morphism cards
- [x] Registered `DeepDive` in `src/Root.tsx`
- [x] Created & rendered `deep-how-ai-reads.json` — "How AI reads your question" (2:46, 3.7MB)
- [x] Created & rendered `deep-birthday-paradox.json` — Birthday Problem math explainer (3:10, 4.4MB)
- [x] Created `deep-one-percent.json` — "1% daily improvement myth" debunking spec
- [x] Wrote exploration 063: Tool-driven content discovery — mapped tool capabilities to 10 content genres, ranked top 8 topics
- [x] Fixed JSON parsing issue with Chinese quotation marks `""` in specs (use `「」` instead)

### In Progress
- [ ] Rendering `deep-one-percent.json` (was in progress when session ended, ~164s/2:44 expected)
- [ ] No commits made yet on `autopilot-0008`

### Blocked
- Ren's review of existing 34 short video specs and first publish approval still pending

## Key Decisions
- **DeepDive composition over TransitionSeries**: Used Sequence-based scene switching with per-scene backgrounds rather than TransitionSeries crossfades, keeping pipeline compatibility with `render-with-voice.ts`
- **Non-AI content expansion**: Birthday Paradox and 1% myth chosen as proof-of-concept for expanding beyond AI topics
- **Scene type system**: 6 types (chapter/text/data/quote/code/comparison) cover the visual vocabulary needed for long-form explainers
- **Chinese quotes in JSON**: Use `「」` not `""` to avoid JSON parsing errors

## Next Steps
1. Verify `deep-one-percent.mp4` rendered successfully, commit all three specs + DeepDive composition
2. Create remaining specs from exploration 063's top 8 list (Monty Hall, Dunning-Kruger, encryption, recommendation algorithms, Chinese Room)
3. Experiment with embedding Manim video clips inside Remotion compositions (combine tools)
4. Test YunjianNeural voice for explainer content (deeper, more authoritative)
5. Update daily note `2026-02-16.md` with this session's work
6. Update `SERIES.md` with new "深度解读" (Deep Dive) series
7. Re-render existing 34 short videos (silent audio bug was fixed but not re-rendered)

## Critical Context
- Render pipeline: `render-with-voice.ts` takes spec JSON → TTS per section → frame timing → Remotion render → ffmpeg combine → final MP4
- Output directory: `/mnt/d/wsl-bridge/remotion-prototype/`
- Specs directory: `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/projects/douyin/tools/remotion-video/specs/`
- Compositions source: `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/projects/douyin/tools/remotion-video/src/`
- Existing compositions: OneMinuteAI, DataViz, TextReveal, AIInsight, DevLog, TokenStream, CarouselSlide, NeuralViz, GradientFlow, Spotlight, **DeepDive** (new)
- Total existing specs: 34 short (40-65s) + 3 long-form DeepDive + 2 carousel = 39 files
- Exploration 063 has the full content strategy and topic ranking

**Turn Context (split turn):**

## Original Request
The user (Ren) provided feedback on their Douyin (TikTok) science videos: the content/structure is good but the visual presentation is too text-heavy. They want to combine **Manim** (math animation library) with **Remotion** to create richer, more diverse animations instead of just showing text. They asked the assistant to remember this feedback and continue working in autonomous mode.

## Early Progress
- Reviewed Remotion's `@remotion/media` video embedding documentation (supports `<Video>` component with trimming, sizing, positioning)
- Installed `@remotion/media` package in the remotion-video project
- Found existing Manim scripts including `manim-attention-mechanism.py` and others
- Reviewed the existing attention mechanism Manim animation (18.7s, 1080x1920 vertical format)
- Created a new focused "B-roll" Manim animation (`manim-attention-layers.py`) showing attention layer stacking with 3 layers (syntax, semantics, intent) and connection visualizations

## Context for Suffix
- The attention layers Manim animation has been rendered successfully to `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/projects/douyin/tools/media/videos/manim-attention-layers/1920p15/AttentionLayers.mp4` (9.4 seconds, ~299KB)
- The Remotion project is at `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/projects/douyin/tools/remotion-video/`
- `@remotion/media` is now installed for embedding video clips
- Next step: embed the rendered Manim clip into a Remotion DeepDive composition to validate the Manim+Remotion workflow
- The project creates vertical format (1080x1920) Douyin videos with a "DeepDive" composition system
