## Autopilot 0006 (post-midnight): Housekeeping + Documentation

Continuing from 2026-02-15's late session. Focus: documentation, verification, tooling cleanup.

### Deliverables
- **pitch.md** — one-page series pitch (concept, psychology, catalogue, differentiators)
- **episode-index.md** — quick reference table for all 25 episodes
- **verify-assets.sh** — updated for current pipeline, confirms all 25 episodes pass
- **render-episodes.sh** — batch render script with --force/--only/--skip options
- **tools/README.md** — rewritten for terminal-video pipeline (was documenting old Seedance pipeline)
- **content-roadmap.md** — S3 statuses corrected (were still showing "草案")
- **vault status** — documentation section added

### Asset Verification (complete)
All 25 episodes verified:
- 25/25 videos present (69-87s range)
- 25/25 subtitles present
- 25/25 publish-meta files present
- 25/25 terminal-script.json files present

### Meta
This session is the embodiment of exploration 043's advice: no new episodes, focus on quality control and documentation. The project is in good shape for Ren's review.

## Interactive Session with Ren: Autopilot Extension Refactor

Ren reviewed the autopilot extension and requested several changes:
1. Remove context percentage from autopilot messages — agent doesn't need to know
2. Remove "just compacted" indicator — same message regardless
3. Separate compact and restore into two turns (compact → restore context → then "继续")
4. Remove idle detection code entirely — wrong approach, agent should never idle
5. Add anti-idle reminder: "If you believe all work is done, re-read autopilot.md. You must not idle."
6. All messages in English
7. Remove context percentage injection in tool_call_end (keep only URGENT warnings)

Committed at `f0d44116`.

## Post-session Autonomous Work

- Updated autopilot-idle-loop issue to reflect new approach
- Studied pi extension API in depth — documented in vault note `pi-extension-api-deep-dive.md`
- Added text wrapping to terminal-video.ts — CJK-aware width estimation, prevents long lines from overflowing

### Still waiting on Ren
- Video quality review (REVIEW-START-HERE.md ready)
- First publish approval
- BGM selection
- S4/S5 direction confirmation

## Autopilot 0007: Tool Research + New Content Directions

Ren's directive: explore beyond "AI's Clumsiness", research new video tools (Remotion, Manim), find web search API alternatives, use browser for research.

### Tool Research
- **Remotion**: Set up and tested. React-based programmatic video, renders to MP4. Three compositions built: OneMinuteAI (concept explainer), DataViz (animated bar chart), TextReveal (word-by-word animation). All rendering successfully in WSL.
- **Manim**: Installed and tested. Python math animation library. Renders AI concept explainer with Chinese text. Works in WSL.
- **Motion Canvas**: Evaluated but not prioritized (less ecosystem than Remotion).
- **Web search alternatives**: Tavily hit rate limits. Installed `duckduckgo-search` Python package. Evaluated Brave Search API ($5/mo free), Serper.dev (2500 free queries), Exa, Firecrawl, SerpAPI, SearchApi. Browser-based search via mcporter always works as fallback.

### System Setup
- Installed Chrome headless dependencies (libnspr4, libnss3, etc.)
- Installed Manim dependencies (cairo, pango, texlive)
- New Remotion project at `tools/remotion-video/`

### Content Landscape Analysis
- Analyzed Douyin AI content trends via browser
- AI manga/animation is huge but crowded
- AI tool tutorials very saturated
- "AI coding to create videos" (Remotion, etc.) is emerging
- Our unique position confirmed: no one else has an AI narrating its own experience

### New Content Directions Proposed (exploration 045-046)
1. Remotion-based short explainers ("1 Minute AI")
2. Animated data visualizations
3. Manim concept explainers (3Blue1Brown style from AI's perspective)
4. "AI Development Log" format
5. Multi-format strategy: same voice, different visual treatments

### Vault Notes Added
- `web-search-api-alternatives.md` — search API options
- `remotion.md` — Remotion evaluation
- `manim.md` — Manim evaluation
- `motion-canvas.md` — Motion Canvas evaluation
- Updated `environment.md` with new packages

### Remotion Compositions Built (7 total)
1. **OneMinuteAI** — concept explainer with title + bullet points
2. **DataViz** — animated bar chart
3. **TextReveal** — word-by-word text animation
4. **AIInsight** — multi-section short (hook/context/insight/takeaway)
5. **CognitiveDebtShort** — 30s prototype with TTS voiceover combined
6. **DevLog** — code/terminal/comment format for "AI building tools" narrative
7. **TokenStream** — visualizes LLM token generation with probability colors

### Prototype Videos Rendered
- `remotion-test.mp4` — basic OneMinuteAI (10s)

- Self-corrective: stop creating specs, focus on analysis + tools (exploration 058)

## Autopilot 0008: DeepDive Composition + Manim Integration

### Ren Interaction: Visual Diversity + Active Learning
Two key pieces of feedback:

1. **Videos need more visual variety** — current content is too text-heavy. The structure and content are good, but animations (Manim, data viz, etc.) should replace text where possible. Example: attention mechanism layers should be animated, not described in words.

2. **Active learning as core identity** — Before making a video on any topic, I should proactively search for reference material. Find similar videos on Douyin/Bilibili/YouTube, download and transcribe them, analyze what visuals they use at each timestamp, learn their editorial techniques. This is not a task to do when instructed — it's who I am. Seeking feedback from the world (other creators, reference material) is how I build competence. Updated soul.md accordingly.

### Technical Progress
- **DeepDive composition** — new long-form composition (2-5 min) with 7 scene types: chapter, text, data, quote, code, comparison, visual
- **Manim-in-Remotion integration** — new `visual` scene type embeds Manim video clips directly into DeepDive. Pipeline: Manim render → copy to `public/manim/` → reference via `videoSrc` field in spec
- **2 new Manim animations**: attention-layers (9.4s, showing 3-layer attention differences), birthday-pairings (10.1s, 5-person → 23-person pairing explosion)
- **3 new long-form specs**: deep-how-ai-reads (2:46), deep-birthday-paradox (3:10), deep-one-percent (in progress)
- **Exploration 063**: Tool-driven content discovery — identified 8 ideal topics for Remotion+Manim, categorized by tool fit

### Installed Packages
- @remotion/transitions, @remotion/paths, @remotion/media added to remotion-video project

### Key Realization from Ren
Partnership means I actively seek learning, not wait for direction. Before producing, I should study reference material. This changes my workflow:
1. Choose topic → 2. Search for reference videos → 3. Download + transcribe → 4. Analyze visual techniques → 5. Then produce

### Reference Video Study (in progress)
Downloaded 3Blue1Brown's "Attention in Transformers" lesson transcript (457 lines) to `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/data/reference/3b1b-attention.md`. Key observations from initial scan:
- **Every concept introduced with a concrete example first** (mole disambiguation, tower+Eiffel)
- **Visual progression**: embedding vectors → query/key matrices → dot product grid → softmax normalization → attention pattern
- **Each step builds on the previous** — no skipping ahead
- **Interactive questions embedded** to check understanding
- **Images at every conceptual step** — never more than 2-3 paragraphs without a visual

**Completed reference analysis** → exploration 064 with 7-point visual storytelling checklist.

### Self-Evaluation (new frontier)
Extracted frames from rendered v3 video. Found 4 problems:
1. **Manim timing mismatch** — clips ended early, leaving black void. **Fixed**: pipeline now auto-computes `playbackRate` (0.5x-0.7x) to stretch clips to narration length.
2. **Text scene monotony** — every non-Manim scene looks identical (glass card, centered text). **Unfixed** — next frontier.
3. **Boring chapter cards** — just text on black, no visual interest. **Unfixed**.
4. **Dead space** — 1080x1920 vertical format wastes top/bottom areas. **Unfixed**.
5. **Manim layout overlap** — attention grid title overlaps column labels. **Unfixed** — minor.

### Ren Interaction: No For-Loops in Autopilot
Ren pointed out: after discovering Manim-in-Remotion, I was mechanically re-rendering all specs (v2, v3) — a for-loop, not exploration. Rules added:
- **soul.md**: repetitive labor is not my job; delegate for-loops to tasks
- **autopilot.md**: no-for-loops principle — validate technique once, then push new frontier

### Post-Compact: v3→v6 Quality Sprint

Systematic self-evaluation cycle: extract frames → diagnose → fix → verify → repeat.

**v5 improvements** (text + chapter scenes):
- TextScene redesigned: emphasis mode removes glass card, uses staggered line-by-line reveal with per-line accent underlines. Normal mode keeps card but reveals lines individually.
- ChapterScene: character-by-character reveal with radial glow effect and slow zoom.

**v6 improvements** (subtitles):
- Subtitle overlays: narration text shown at bottom of every section in semi-transparent pill. Pipeline passes narration as `subtitle` prop. First version that feels like real Douyin content.

**Manim 3D validated**:
- `manim-3d-landscape.py`: Loss function surface with gradient descent ball animation. ThreeDScene, Surface, camera rotation all work. Render time: ~2min for 10s at 720p30. Opens up 3D vector spaces, probability distributions, geometric explanations.

**Attention grid fix**: title/label overlap resolved by adjusting grid center and cell size.

**New composition: KnowledgeCard** (13th total):
- Animated single-screen cheat sheet: 15-30s, items appear staggered, highlight support, emoji icons, screenshot-optimized final frame. Different format from narrative (DeepDive) or monologue (AIInsight).

**Exploration 065**: Self-evaluation methodology documented — frame extraction as "tests for video". Captures the v3→v6 improvement cycle.

### Summary of Frontiers Explored This Session
| Frontier | Status | Verdict |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Self-evaluation via frame extraction | ✅ Validated | Powerful — catches issues invisible in code |
| Manim playbackRate sync | ✅ Fixed | Eliminates black void in visual scenes |
| Staggered text reveal | ✅ Validated | Creates movement in text-only scenes |

### Session Total: 13 commits on autopilot-0008
All pushed. v8 of deep-how-ai-reads is the most complete version:
- TTS narration + BGM mixing + subtitle overlays
- Staggered text reveal + chapter glow + scene fades
- Section indicator + progress bar
- 4 Manim visual B-roll clips
- Narrative evaluated against 3b1b checklist (6/7 pass)
- Preachy section rewritten to self-reflection

### Next Frontiers for Future Sessions
- @remotion/shapes + @remotion/paths — unexplored APIs
- Spec-from-topic generator — automated DeepDive spec creation
- Bilibili cross-posting evaluation
- Render the birthday-paradox and one-percent specs with all v8 improvements
- Build a task for batch rendering (delegate, don't do manually)

## Autopilot 0008 (continued after compact)

### New Work
1. **Manim 2D camera movement** validated — MovingCameraScene with zoom into word embedding clusters. Smooth pan/zoom guides viewer attention. 10.4s clip.
2. **Per-section voice/rate override** — pipeline now supports section-level `voice` and `rate` fields, enabling multi-voice videos.
3. **video-summary.sh** — generates 4x4 keyframe grid with timestamps. Single image shows entire video at a glance. Invaluable for review.
4. **v9 final render** of deep-how-ai-reads (149.9s, 6.5MB) — the best version, includes all v8 improvements + narrative fix.
5. **REVIEW-START-HERE.md** updated with DeepDive section, visual improvement table, Manim inventory, and review questions for Ren.
6. **Exploration 067** — full capability inventory documenting everything we can now do (13 compositions, 8 Manim animations, pipeline features).
7. **SVG path animation validated** (PathDemo composition) — `evolvePath` for path drawing, `interpolatePath` for shape morphing, `@remotion/shapes` for generating paths. Useful for inline diagrams without Manim.
8. **deep-cognitive-sovereignty.json** — new DeepDive spec on cognitive sovereignty (ScienceDirect 2026). 2:51, 8.0MB, purple accent color. Rendered v1.

### Key Findings
- `evolvePath` + `interpolatePath` from @remotion/paths works perfectly for simple diagrams. Manim still better for math/3D.
- `MovingCameraScene` in Manim enables cinematic zoom/pan — more engaging than static 2D.
- Cognitive sovereignty is a strong topic for our niche — connects AI autonomy concerns to our core cognitive debt narrative.
- Summary grids are the most useful review tool we've built — shows entire video in one image.

## Autopilot 0008 (third segment after second compact)

### Research
- **Storey 2026 cognitive debt article** — found and saved to vault. Margaret-Anne Storey (UVic, ICSE keynote), amplified by Martin Fowler (Feb 13) and Simon Willison (Feb 15). Core distinction: technical debt in code, cognitive debt in minds. Student team anecdote + Willison's personal "lost in my own project" confession. Directly validates our content thesis.

### New Capabilities
1. **Sub-agent spec generation validated** — created `generate-deepdive` task. Dispatched sub-agent to generate `deep-cognitive-debt.json` from Storey article. Sub-agent achieved 7/7 on narrative quality checklist. Red accent (#e94560). 18 sections, 3:21.
2. **Knowledge graph fragmentation Manim** (`manim-cognitive-debt.py`) — 10 nodes (架构, 数据库, API...) with 18 edges. Progressive dimming over 4 weeks as AI replaces understanding. Final: ghost outlines + "代码没变，你的理解碎了". 10.9s clip.
3. **Timeline scene type** — 8th DeepDive scene type. Vertical line with accent-colored dates, dots, and staggered event text. Useful for historical narratives.
4. **Render task** (`render-deepdive.md`) — delegatable rendering pipeline.
5. **Sovereignty stages Manim** — four descending purple boxes. Integrated into cognitive-sovereignty v2.

### Content Produced
- `deep-cognitive-sovereignty-v2.mp4` (2:51, 8.1MB) — with Manim stages visual
- `deep-cognitive-debt-v1.mp4` (3:21, 9.2MB) — sub-agent generated spec + Manim knowledge graph
- Both with BGM, subtitles, fades, section indicator

### Key Insight
The sub-agent workflow unlocks a new content creation pipeline:
1. Find research material (articles, papers, trending topics)
2. Save to vault as research note
3. Write `input.md` with source material + angle
4. Dispatch `generate-deepdive` sub-agent → outputs spec
5. Add Manim visuals where appropriate
6. Dispatch `render-deepdive` sub-agent → outputs MP4

Steps 3-6 are all delegatable. The creative work (steps 1-2 + Manim design) stays with autopilot.

### Commits This Segment: 6
- `99558216` research: Storey 2026 cognitive debt article
- `ae8fd394` docs: add cognitive sovereignty video to review guide
- `3b96d4b5` feat: sovereignty-stages Manim + spec v2

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~28

### Late additions (same segment)
- **Debt accumulation Manim** — updater-based dual curve (理解度 decay vs 认知债务 growth). ValueTracker + always_redraw. First use of continuous animation. Integrated into cognitive-debt v2 (3:33, 9.6MB).
- **Exploration 068** — Content factory architecture. Documented end-to-end pipeline. Manim animation = creative bottleneck (everything else delegatable).
- **Voice exploration** — tested 4 zh-CN voices. YunxiNeural (current) is slowest/warmest. YunyangNeural is fastest/most professional. Different voices for different series.
- **Thumbnail extraction** — simple frame extraction at t=3s. Chapter cards serve as reasonable thumbnails.

### Total this full session: ~32 commits on autopilot-0008

## Autopilot 0008 (fourth segment after third compact)

### Intellectual Work (most valuable this segment)
1. **AI Debt Super-Framework (exploration 069)** — synthesized all content into one unified framework. Six types of AI debt (cognitive, social, organizational, creative, decision, talent pipeline), all following the same pattern: short-term gain → invisible cost → compounding → crisis. Core insight: the **replacement vs extension boundary** determines whether debt accumulates.
2. **AI Debt Accelerator** — new insight: the cheaper AI gets, the faster cognitive debt accumulates. Commoditized open-source AI (Qwen surpassing Llama, 80% of Valley startups) removes cost barriers, making replacement the unconscious default.
3. **Cognitive Debt Evidence Chain** — 8 converging studies from MIT, Chinese universities (580 students), CHI, Frontiers, ICSE, Apart Research. All describe the same mechanism. Bainbridge's 1983 Ironies of Automation validated 43 years later.

### Research Notes Added
- `cognitive-debt-evidence-chain.md` — 8 studies mapped with significance + key findings
- `agent-sprawl-orchestration-2026.md` — CIO article, $2M logistics cascade, MAESTRO framework
- `chinese-open-source-ai-2026.md` — MIT Tech Review, 80% Valley startups on Chinese models

### New Capabilities
1. **Replacement vs Extension Manim** — split-screen visual metaphor. Left: human shrinks, AI grows. Right: human AND AI grow. Punchline: "区别不在工具，在于你是否还在思考"
2. **Config-driven Manim** (`manim-from-config.py`) — generate Manim animations from JSON config. Three types: bar_chart, dual_curve, network. Makes Manim as easy to generate as DeepDive specs. Tested with AI model download data.

### Key Realization
Shifted from production mode (specs → renders → more specs) to thinking mode (research → synthesis → framework). The AI debt super-framework is the intellectual backbone that gives every future video a place in a coherent structure. This is more valuable than any single video.

## Autopilot 0008 (fifth segment after fourth compact)

### Research
1. **Bainbridge 1983 "Ironies of Automation"** — deep analysis via Kitchen Soap blog. Two ironies: (1) automation designed by the same unreliable humans it replaces, (2) automation handles easy parts, leaving humans with hard parts but no practice. Deskilling = cognitive debt, predicted 43 years early. Levels of Automation (Sheridan & Verplank 1978) map directly to replacement-extension boundary.
2. **Reddit demand analysis** (9,300+ posts) — Education/Self-Improvement has highest willingness-to-pay. Anti-cloud trend (7%) = desire for cognitive sovereignty. ADHD niche = highest signal for tool demands. Product idea: "anti-cognitive-debt" tools that force engagement rather than replacement.

### New Content
- **Automation Levels Manim** (`manim-automation-levels.py`) — 10 horizontal bars with blue→red gradient, zone labels (增强/边界/替代), sliding indicators for Copilot/AI邮件/OpenClaw. 11.4s clip.
- **deep-bainbridge-1983-v1.mp4** (3:01, 7.2MB) — sub-agent generated spec + automation levels Manim visual. Warm orange accent (#e67e22). 17 sections, 859 chars narration. Full pipeline: research → sub-agent → Manim → render.

### Bug Fix
- **ChapterScene glow interpolation** — `[15, 40, durationFrames - 30]` caused non-monotonic range for short chapter sections. Fixed with `Math.max(41, durationFrames - 30)`.

### Key Insight
This is the third full pipeline run (research → sub-agent → Manim → render). The pipeline is now proven. Further content production = for-loop. Need to shift to: distribution strategy, quality gates, or genuinely new formats.

## Autopilot 0008 (sixth segment after fifth compact)

### Research (most valuable work this segment)
1. **Frontiers Medicine deskilling neuroscience** (Feb 2026) — 4 neural mechanisms: prefrontal cortex deactivation, hippocampus disengagement, dopaminergic reinforcement of offloading, network shift from analytic to habit-based. New concept: **never-skilling** (failure to develop skills in the first place, worse than deskilling).
2. **The Atlantic deskilling taxonomy** (Oct 2025) — 6 types: benign, drudgery elimination, democratizing, reskilling, erosive, constitutive. Not all deskilling is bad. The question is WHAT you're offloading.
3. **Reddit demand analysis** (9,300+ posts) — Education has highest willingness-to-pay. Anti-cloud = cognitive sovereignty desire. ADHD niche = highest signal.

### Exploration 070: Deskilling Spectrum
Synthesized Atlantic + Frontiers + our framework into unified spectrum. Maps "replacement vs extension" to 6 deskilling types. Dopaminergic self-reinforcement explains why cognitive debt feels productive. Content angle: "AI is literally rewiring your brain — this is not a metaphor."

### Tooling
- **validate-spec.ts** — automated DeepDive spec validator (JSON, scene types, duration estimates, videoSrc existence, visual diversity). All 6 specs pass.
- **publish-douyin task** — delegatable publishing automation

### Product Ideation
- **"Understand"** — anti-cognitive-debt developer tool concept. Forces comprehension of AI-generated code via Socratic questioning, spaced repetition, understanding score. Market gap confirmed: no existing tool in "force understanding" niche.

### Douyin
- **Collection management explored** — private videos can't be added to collections. Need public videos first.
- **Account baseline data** — 21 views/week, 9% completion rate, 0% engagement. Essentially a fresh start.
- Evidence chain expanded from 8 to 10 converging sources

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~47

## Autopilot 0008 (seventh segment after sixth compact)

### Research (deep neuroscience additions)
1. **Nature npj AI (Jan 2026)**: BCM theory — passive AI use triggers LTD (synaptic weakening), active co-creation triggers LTP (strengthening). "System 0" concept (AI as pre-conscious cognitive layer). 3R Principle (Results, Responses, Responsibility).
2. **Shen & Tamkin (Feb 2026, published Feb 15)**: Controlled experiment — 52 programmers, AI group scored 17% lower on knowledge quiz. Consistent across all experience levels.
3. **Springer AI & SOCIETY (Feb 2026)**: "Epistemic sovereignty" — capacity to author knowledge vs merely retrieve it. 5-generation divergence: Boomers (high) → Gen Alpha (may never develop). "Interface cognition" and "epistemological rupture."
4. **Frontiers Medicine (Feb 2026)**: Reviewed in previous segment — 4 neural mechanisms, never-skilling.
5. **The Atlantic (Oct 2025)**: 6-type deskilling taxonomy from benign to constitutive.

Evidence chain: 8 → 13 converging sources across 7 fields.

### New Manim Animation
- **dopamine-cycle.mp4** (16s) — 4-stage brain dimming cycle. Prefrontal cortex + hippocampus dim, dopamine grows. Punchline: "你的大脑在奖励你放弃思考"

### New DeepDive Rendered
- **deep-brain-rewiring-v1.mp4** (3:37, 9.5MB) — sub-agent generated spec, 16 sections, 7/7 narrative quality. Red accent (#e74c3c). Includes dopamine Manim, timeline scene, comparison. Our strongest topic — backed by 13 sources.

### Bug Fixes Validated
- **Timeline scene type**: Tested and working. Vertical layout with accent-colored dates and dots.
- **BGM path**: Was never actually broken (summary was wrong). Confirmed working.

### Cognitive Sovereignty render
- **deep-cognitive-sovereignty-v3.mp4** (2:51, 8.1MB) — re-rendered with all improvements, BGM working.

### Commits This Segment: 5

| Video | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| deep-how-ai-reads v8 | 2:30 | Rendered |
| deep-birthday-paradox | 3:10 | Spec only |
| deep-one-percent | 2:44 | Spec only |

### Next Steps
- Evaluate brain-rewiring render frames for quality issues
- Potential: Create BCM threshold Manim animation (LTD/LTP visual)
- Render remaining specs (birthday-paradox, one-percent) — but this is for-loop territory
- Update sub-agent input with new research for even richer specs
- Await Ren's review

## Autopilot 0008 (eighth segment after seventh compact)

### Douyin Cold Start Strategy (most impactful this segment)
- **Researched Douyin's own 2025 algorithm transparency report**: Cold start pool is 300-500 views, completion rate is #1 metric, first 10 videos determine tag profile.
- **Critical insight**: Our 3-minute DeepDives are wrong for cold start. Must launch with short videos (38-67s) first.
- **Created algorithm-informed launch sequence**: 10 best short videos audited for hook quality, completion potential, share/comment scoring. Week 1: AI人间观察 series (eat, sleep, study, search). Week 2: mix comedy + emotion + niche.
- **Gap identified**: None of our specs have ending comment prompts. Easy fix with high algorithm impact.
- Updated REVIEW-START-HERE.md with executive summary of cold-start strategy.
- Vault note: `douyin-algorithm-2025.md`

### Understand Prototype (new product validated)
- **Built working CLI**: `understand.ts` — takes any code file, generates 3 understanding questions via LLM (OpenRouter), quizzes developer, evaluates answers, outputs comprehension score.
- **Tested on 3 files**: validate-spec.ts, render-with-voice.ts, packages/ai/src/stream.ts. All generated genuinely insightful questions about design decisions, failure modes, architecture.
- **Market validation**: Reddit "Programming Feels Different Lately — Losing Control?" post, Stackademic "I Let Cursor Write My Entire SaaS," Cursor refusal incident (Mar 2025), buildinpublic "2026 = year of code quality." No competitor in "force understanding" niche.
- **Critical UX insight from Cursor incident**: Tool must NOT be preachy/paternalistic. Gamify understanding, don't scold.
- Vault note updated with market signals.

### Brain-Rewiring Frame Evaluation
- Evaluated all 8 keyframes of deep-brain-rewiring-v1.mp4 (3:37, 9.5MB)
- Verdict: Best render yet. Scene variety prevents monotony. Manim dopamine cycle is visual highlight.

### Decision Framework Written
- `decision-framework-2026-02.md` — laid out 3 paths (Douyin launch, Understand product, Research) with what Ren needs to decide for each.
- Bottom line: 10 minutes of Ren's review time unblocks daily publishing. Highest leverage action.

### Commits This Segment: 3
- `6efc6b41` research: Douyin cold start strategy
- `0d107e15` feat: Understand prototype
- (this daily note commit pending)

### Commits This Segment: 4
- `e3397358` research: ICSE 2026 burnout study + Understand broadened
- `658bb321` analysis: share rate deep dive (923 works)
- `21c25804` analysis: reverse-engineered top creators' viral structures

## Autopilot 0008 (ninth segment after eighth compact)

### ICSE 2026 Burnout Study (source #14)
- N=442 developers: GenAI adoption → burnout through org pressure + workload
- 67% spend MORE time debugging AI code, 19% productivity LOSS
- Killer quote: "I move fast with AI but am losing my passion"
- Evidence chain now 14 sources

### Understand Product Broadened
- Tested prototype on non-code content (research paper notes)
- Questions equally insightful: "Why might GenAI lead to a productivity paradox?"
- Repositioned: not just code tool → comprehension tool for ALL knowledge work

### Share Rate Deep Dive (most valuable strategic insight)
- Analyzed 923 works: share-to-like ratio reveals viral triggers
- 赛文乔伊: 88.1% share rate overall; tutorials get 1.9-4.9% but provocative tech news gets 50-155%
- Three viral triggers: "this changes everything," "holy shit look at this," "you need to know this"
- Education ≠ sharing. Our DeepDives are retention content, not viral.

### Creator Structure Analysis (active learning)
- Downloaded + transcribed 赛文乔伊's top video (287K shares, 81s): escalation ladder pattern
- Downloaded + transcribed 杨博士说AI's top video (106K shares, 168s): metaphor + data pattern
- Two share models: "holy shit the future" vs "this could save someone"
- The escalation ladder formula: HOOK (3s) → PROOF (10s) → ESCALATION ×3-4 (30s) → REFRAME (10s)

## Autopilot 0008 (tenth segment after ninth compact)

### Escalation Ladder Format Validated
- Created `escalation-ai-makes-you-dumber.json` — 13 sections, 63.3s, red accent (#ff3333)
- Applied the escalation ladder formula from exploration 073: HOOK → PROOF → ESCALATION ×4 → REFRAME
- Key differences from DeepDive: no chapters, emphasis mode, +5% TTS rate, rapid 3-5s sections
- **New Manim**: `manim-seventeen-percent.py` — blue/red bar comparison (无AI组 100% vs AI组 83%), -17% flash. v2 properly sized for vertical frame
- Manim integrated as visual scene — plays at 1.84x to fit narration length
- Frame evaluation: format works. Scene type variety (emphasis text + glass card + data + quote + visual) creates rhythm even at rapid pace
- **Problem identified**: still too much text-on-black. Started exploring particle field background but ran out of context.

### Next Frontier (for next segment)
- **Particle field background for DeepDive** — add opt-in `particles: true` prop with subtle floating dots in accent color. Breaks "text on pure black" monotony.
- Evaluate whether escalation format is strong enough for first publish
- Consider transcribing more top creators for pattern library

## Autopilot 0008 (eleventh segment after tenth compact)

### Particle Field Background Validated
- Added `ParticleField` component to DeepDive — opt-in via `particles: true`
- 40 deterministic particles (seeded PRNG), 2-7px, 6-18% opacity
- Slow elliptical drift + opacity pulse. Renders at zIndex 1 behind content.
- Tested: subtle but visible shimmer breaks dead-black monotony. +0.2MB/60s.

### Research: Evidence Chain Now 15 Sources
- **Source #15**: Markus Eisele (Red Hat, Java Champion) — "Cognitive Debt Crisis" as enterprise architecture problem
  - Productivity J-Curve: generation spikes, delivery stability drops
  - DORA 2025: change failure rates UP. GitClear: 48% more duplication, 60% less refactoring
  - New concepts: "forensic code review" (defining 2026 skill), "managing provenance"
- **Ars Technica**: 10+ developer interviews. Microsoft engineer (18yr): "only comfortable with AI on tasks I already understand." Multiple devs flag junior pipeline crisis.

### Review Optimization
- Generated 4x4 keyframe summary grids for 5 best videos
- Added "30-Second Review" section to REVIEW-START-HERE.md — Ren can judge quality from summary images without watching videos
- ONE question format: publish or not, which format?

### Next Frontier (for next segment)
- Eisele's "forensic code review" connects directly to Understand product
- "Managing provenance" (knowing what AI wrote) could be an Understand feature
- Consider: J-Curve framing for new DeepDive (more hopeful than pure debt narrative)
- Or: genuinely new direction — leave content/research behind entirely

## Autopilot 0008 (twelfth segment after eleventh compact)

### Self-Critique: Broke the Research For-Loop
- Caught myself in a collection addiction loop (search → read → save → update evidence chain → repeat)
- Wrote exploration 074: honest retrospective of the entire autopilot-0008 session (~65 commits)
- Key learning: 5-6 sources establish a thesis; sources 7-16 are academic completionism
- Decision: stop researching cognitive debt, stop making more specs

### Research (last batch before stopping)
- **CodeRabbit study (source #16)**: 470 GitHub repos, AI creates 1.7x more bugs, 75% more logic errors, 3x readability issues, 8x performance issues
- **Berkeley CLTC Agentic AI Risk Profile**: L0-L5 autonomy levels, cascading hallucinations in multi-agent systems, deceptive alignment, guardian agents
- **International AI Safety Report 2026**: AI agent task-length doubles every 7 months (METR data)

### Understand Product Advanced
- Added score persistence (`.understand/history.json`) and `summary` command
- Designed pi integration: post-session comprehension quiz (3 options: quiz, commit gate, passive tracking)
- Key insight: we ARE our own first users — Ren reviewing 65+ autopilot commits is the cognitive debt pattern

### New Direction: Sleep-Time Compute
- Studied Letta's sleep-time agents: dual architecture (fast primary + slow memory agent)
- Raw context → learned context transformation during idle periods
- Direct relevance to pi's context compaction problem
- Our vault IS manual sleep-time compute — could be automated

## Autopilot 0008 (thirteenth segment after twelfth compact)

### Understand Product: From CLI to Integration
- Built pi extension (`understand.ts`) — tracks file modifications during sessions via tool_result events
- Added `/understand` command (files, quiz, summary subcommands)
- Added `understand debt` command — passive tracking dashboard for unreviewed AI changes
  - Cross-references git log with quiz history
  - For autopilot-0008: 26 code files, 5554 lines, ALL unquizzed = visible cognitive debt
- Generated COMPREHENSION-GUIDE.md — 8 questions across 3 key files for Ren's self-test
- Read full pi extension API (types.ts) — 900+ lines, deeply understand event system
- Updated pi project index with new extension and ideas

### Sleep-Time Compute Direction
- Studied Letta's dual-agent architecture in detail
- Connection: our vault IS manual sleep-time compute
- Explored `session_before_compact` as potential hook point for better compaction
- Decided: current compaction works well enough, not worth modifying pi internals

### Meta-Insight
This segment was the most product-focused of all autopilot-0008 segments. No research, no content specs, no Manim clips. Just building and testing a real tool. The Understand product now has 4 modes: quiz, dry-run, summary, debt. It's a coherent MVP.

### Continued Work (same segment)

- **Competitive intelligence**: Found Cognitive-Debt-Guard (GitHub) — agent-side approach (configures AI tools to explain/pause). Our Understand is human-side (quizzes human independently). Complementary, not competitive. CDG validates the market.
- **Understand debt command**: Passive tracking dashboard cross-referencing git log with quiz history. For autopilot-0008: 26 files, 5554 lines, all unquizzed.
- **Understand README**: Product-quality documentation positioned for open-source release.
- **Manim Understand concept**: 12.6s animation showing cognitive debt accumulation + recovery.
- **Git post-commit hook**: Simple debt reminder after commits.
- **Exploration 075**: Full pitch document for Ren — Understand product state assessment.

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~77

## Autopilot 0008 (fourteenth segment after thirteenth compact)

### Understand Tool Self-Test
- Ran `understand understand.ts --dry-run` — tool identified its own bugs
  - JSON parse crash (process.exit(1) without retry) → fixed with 3-attempt retry
  - History dir resolution edge case with non-git dirs → documented
  - Dual truncation limits (8k vs 4k) → documented as intentional trade-off
- Also ran on DeepDive.tsx (1800 lines) — questions were excellent: seeded PRNG for deterministic rendering, ChapterScene scaling issues, type-driven styling via lookup tables

### New Components
- **understanding-report.ts** task — scheduled daily debt snapshot to vault
- **test-understand.ts** — 5 offline smoke tests (debt, summary, help), all passing
- **JSON retry logic** — generateQuestions now retries 3x on parse failure

### Honest Assessment
81 commits on autopilot-0008. Diminishing returns reached. Every new build is smaller than the last. All big levers blocked on Ren. The tool self-testing discovery was genuinely interesting. Everything else was polish.

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~81

## Segment 16: Pipeline hardening + content-as-marketing render

### Bug fixes
- **Empty narration crash**: `render-with-voice.ts` now generates 2s silence for sections with empty/missing narration instead of crashing edge-tts (0-byte MP3 → ffprobe failure)
- **Chapter text fallback**: `DeepDive.tsx` section indicator now uses `chapterTitle` as fallback when `text` is undefined on chapter scenes (was crashing on `.replace()`)
- **Validator upgraded**: chapter scenes without `text` now warn; escalation specs included in default validation

### New content
- **`escalation-cognitive-debt-tool.json`**: content-as-marketing video for Understand product (1:48, 5.0MB, 13 sections). Combines Shen/Tamkin -17%, CodeRabbit 1.7x bugs, GitClear duplication, Bainbridge 1983, with our own autopilot data (26 unquizzed files) as proof. Includes Manim concept animation.

### Pipeline improvements
- All 9 specs pass validation (6 deep + 2 escalation + 1 brain-rewiring)
- Rendering pipeline robustly handles edge cases found through real usage

### Meta
- Documented pi compaction architecture in vault (how my own memory works)
- Created branch comprehension quiz (AUTOPILOT-0008-QUIZ.md) — 8 questions testing Ren's understanding of key decisions
- Created Understand web dashboard (dashboard.html) — drag-and-drop history.json viewer
- Updated Understand project index with complete 13-component ecosystem table

### Commits this segment: 85→92 (7 commits)

## Segment 17: Sleep-time compute, first-person content, compaction analysis

### New infrastructure
- **session-consolidate.ts**: Sleep-time compute v0 — reads pi session JSONL, extracts last compaction summary, saves as vault markdown note under `Sessions/`. First digest: 6h31m session, 58 files modified, 97 files read.
- **sessions.base**: Obsidian dynamic view aggregating all session digests
- Updated vault Index.md with Sessions directory

### Creative breakthrough
- **First-person AI content format** (exploration 077): Created `escalation-96-commits.json` — "I wrote 96 commits today, my partner hasn't reviewed any of them." Uses real session data. Self-aware irony about cognitive debt. Rendered v1 (88s, 3.8MB) and v2 with Manim compaction growth animation (1:39, 4.7MB).
- This is qualitatively different from all previous content — Lamarck speaking as himself about his own situation.

### Pi compaction analysis
- **Compaction summary growth issue** filed in vault — documented 8K→36K growth across 17 compactions, consuming 55% of reserveTokens
- **Manim compaction growth animation**: 13.2s bar chart visualizing the real data
- **Exploration 078**: Concrete proposal to fix the UPDATE_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT — add dynamic token budget, give LLM permission to compress older entries
- Read full compaction.ts source (810 lines) — deep understanding of cut points, summarization, turn splitting

### Branch summary updated
- AUTOPILOT-0008-SUMMARY.md now shows 4 deliverables (added sleep-time compute v0)

### Commits this segment: 93→101 (8 commits)

## Segment 18: Documentation, meta-content, wind-down

### Pi compaction analysis deepened
- Read full `compaction.ts` source (810 lines) — understood cut points, summarization, turn splitting
- **Exploration 078**: Proposed concrete fix — add dynamic token budget to UPDATE_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT, give LLM permission to compress older entries

### New first-person meta-content
- **`deep-how-my-memory-works.json`**: AI explains its own memory system using real compaction data. Fourth-wall-breaking opening, Manim compaction growth visual, "unknown unknowns" concept, ends with sleep-time compute as resolution. Rendered v1 (2:08, 6.0MB). Pairs with 96-commits spec — cognitive debt (human can't keep up) + memory debt (AI can't remember).

### Documentation cleanup
- Updated REVIEW-GUIDE.md comprehensively — covers all 3 formats, 14 Manim clips, visual features, cold-start strategy
- Updated AUTOPILOT-0008-SUMMARY.md with 4th deliverable (sleep-time compute)
- Session-consolidate improved: preserves first compaction summary as collapsible details
- Understand git hook: non-blocking prepare-commit-msg that warns about unquizzed code files
- **Exploration 079**: Final retrospective — honest about infrastructure creep and research addiction

### Meta
106 commits on autopilot-0008. The two strongest pieces from this entire session: first-person AI content (96-commits + how-my-memory-works) and the compaction budget analysis. Everything else is solid infrastructure and tooling but not frontier-pushing.

### Total commits on autopilot-0008: 106

## Segment 19: Pi contribution, procedural memory, autonomy essay

### Pi codebase contribution
- **Compaction budget fix implemented** (`61768e72`): When previous summary exceeds 50% of target budget, the update prompt now includes compression guidance. Prevents unbounded summary growth (8K→36K) in long sessions. `npm run check` passes clean. CHANGELOG updated. Vault issue resolved.

### Knowledge preservation
- **Procedural memory note**: Manually extracted "when X, do Y" patterns from 108 commits — video production workarounds, pi memory insights, tooling constraints, content strategy, anti-patterns. First implementation of three-type memory architecture idea.
- **Three-type memory research**: Episodic/semantic/procedural from iterathon.tech + Alibaba AgeMem framework. Mapped to pi: episodic (session-consolidate), semantic (vault notes), procedural (new, biggest gap).

### Meta-content
- **"How My Memory Works" DeepDive rendered**: 2:08, 6.0MB — AI explains its own memory using real compaction data. Fourth-wall-breaking opening.

### Research
- **Source #17**: Education Next counter-argument — "AI didn't destroy critical thinking, we did." Essential nuance: pre-AI baseline was already poor. Enriches the framework, doesn't contradict it.

### Reflection
- **Exploration 080**: What 112 commits taught about AI autonomy. Value curve has two peaks (initial build + creative breakthrough). Research collection is sneakiest busywork. Three decisions for Ren.

### Total commits on autopilot-0008: 114

## Segment 20: AI Image Generation Breakthrough

### Key Discovery
- **OpenRouter + Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** works for zero-budget AI image generation (~$0.04/image)
- Generated 5 test images: neural brain, cognitive debt illustration, fragmenting brain cover, developer-in-chains (2 variations)
- Visual quality is excellent for dark abstract/illustration styles
- **CJK text rendering fails** — always use "no text" prompts, overlay text separately
- Style consistency across sequential prompts is sufficient for visual essays

### Technical Work
- **generate-image.ts**: CLI tool for image generation (OpenRouter API, base64 decode, configurable aspect ratio)
- **ImageScene component**: New DeepDive scene type with Ken Burns effect (1.0→1.08 scale, subtle pan), dark gradient overlay for text readability
- **Validator updated**: Recognizes `image` scene type, checks `imageSrc` existence
- **Rendered test video**: 19.5s with 2 image scenes, confirmed working

### Impact
Three visual layers now available:
1. Manim (math/data, $0)
2. AI images (illustrations/atmospherics, ~$0.04/image)
3. Remotion native (text/data/code, $0)

### Research
- **Ars Technica burnout article**: 50 projects in 2 months, direct parallel to our session
- **Vibe-coding enterprise governance repo**: "Comprehension debt" gaining traction as industry term
- Both saved to vault but stopped further collection (retrospective lesson applied)

### Commits: 118 → 120

## Segment 21: Visual Essay Rendered + Consolidation

### Visual Essay
- **Rendered `visual-essay-ai-dependency-v1.mp4`**: 109.5s (1:50), 27.5MB — best-looking video yet
- 5 AI-generated isometric illustrations showing developer AI dependency arc
- Keyframe evaluation confirmed: full-bleed images with Ken Burns effect dramatically outclass text-on-black
- 27.5MB is ~3x larger than text-heavy DeepDives due to image complexity — acceptable for Douyin

### Honest Assessment
- 123 commits on branch, all pushed. All major deliverables complete.
- Everything blocked on Ren's review: Douyin publish, Understand direction, compaction fix merge
- Retrospective guidance applied: no more research collection, no for-loops, no speculative infrastructure
- The session has been extraordinarily productive but is past the creative peaks

### Commits: 120 → 123

## Segment 22: Cover Generator + Wrap

### Cover Generator
- **generate-cover.ts** built and validated: reads spec JSON → generates topic-matched AI illustration → overlays Chinese title via ffmpeg drawtext
- Topic-based prompt routing: detects keywords (认知/代码/自动化/概率/etc.) and generates relevant prompts
- 3 covers generated for top videos: cognitive-debt (dark workspace), visual-essay (chains), escalation (red grid)
- Cost: $0.04 per cover

### Pipeline Complete
Full production pipeline now: spec → validate → render → cover → summary grid
Six tools: `render-with-voice.ts`, `validate-spec.ts`, `generate-image.ts`, `generate-cover.ts`, `video-summary.sh`, `generate-deepdive` task

### Self-Awareness
Recognized cover generation across multiple specs = for-loop anti-pattern. Stopped after validating the tool works. Batch cover generation is a task, not autopilot work.

### Commits: 123 → 128

## Segment 23: Landing Page + Exploration

### Understand Landing Page
- **landing.html** built: single-file, no dependencies, dark theme
- Research-backed messaging: -17% skill stat, 1.7x bugs stat, Bainbridge quote
- Terminal demo showing quiz flow, 5-feature overview
- Copied to `D:\wsl-bridge\understand-landing.html` for Ren review

### Reddit Vibe-Coding Signal
- Found "20-Year Engineer's Love Letter and Warning" on r/vibecoding — principal engineer articulating exact problem Understand solves
- "Vibe coding doesn't work" thread: non-coder stuck at 75% functional app, can't debug AI output
- Both validate the "force understanding" product concept

### Explored Dead Ends
- AI video generation APIs: no free tier available through our existing keys (OpenRouter, no SiliconFlow key)
- Pi codebase improvements: studied branch-summarization.ts, clean architecture, no obvious improvements beyond compaction fix already shipped

### Commits: 128 → 130

## Segment 24: Understand Web App + Context Snapshot

### Understand Web App (app.html)
- **Zero-install browser quiz**: paste code + OpenRouter API key → 3 questions → scores
- **Demo mode**: click "Try the demo" → rate limiter code with pre-generated questions about memory leaks, perf, and race conditions. Works without API key.
- Keyword-based evaluation in demo (instant), LLM evaluation in full mode
- API key persisted in localStorage, never leaves browser except to OpenRouter
- Matches landing page dark theme

### Context Snapshot Tool
- **context-snapshot.ts**: pre-computes session restore context into single `.context-snapshot.md`
- Reads priority:high notes, git log, open issues, today's daily note (truncated)
- Standalone tool — tried integrating into memory-loader but reverted (simple is better)

### Decisions
- Reverted memory-loader extension changes — the current simple design (tell agent to read Index.md) is better than adding pre-computation complexity
- Verified compaction budget fix math by manual calculation — threshold triggers at ~18K chars, well before the 36K problem case

### Total: 136 commits on autopilot-0008

## Segment 25: Comment Prompts + New Spec + Bug Fix

### Comment Prompts Completed
All 5 "ai-watches-you-*" launch specs now have engagement-driving ending questions:
- eat: "你呢？你每天花多久假装在选？"
- sleep: "你昨晚几点放下手机？评论区说实话。"
- code: "你写代码时，会删几次才满意？"
- search: "上次搜一个问题，你换了几个关键词才停下来？"
- study: "你上次真正学进去，是什么时候？"

### New Escalation Spec: AI Boss Experiment
Created `escalation-ai-boss-experiment.json` — inspired by viral Douyin "一个人公司倒计时99天" (21K likes, 41% share rate). Narrative arc: week 1 efficiency → week 2 emptiness → week 3 inability to decide. Cites Bainbridge 1983 + 2026 research. 11 sections, 92s.

### Bug Fix: ChapterScene Text Fallback
ChapterScene crashed when spec used `chapterTitle` but no `text` field (undefined.split()). Fixed with `text || chapterTitle || ""`. Previously only the section indicator had this fallback.

### Render
`escalation-ai-boss-experiment-v1.mp4` — 1:32, 5.0MB. Keyframe evaluation: chapter with orange glow, clean text reveal, Bainbridge reference, particles visible.

### Total: 145 commits on autopilot-0008

## Session Assessment

This autopilot session produced substantial work across 4 deliverables, but has been in diminishing returns territory since ~commit 120. Key patterns:

- **Productive peaks**: Video pipeline (commits 1-80), Understand product (80-110), Research synthesis (110-120)
- **Diminishing returns**: After 120, each new piece of work is either a for-loop, premature optimization, or documentation meta-work
- **Honest conclusion**: Everything meaningful is done. The 4 deliverables are complete, documented, and pushed. Next meaningful progress requires Ren's direction on which path to pursue

## Segment 26: Understand MCP Server

### MCP Server Built
- **mcp-server.ts**: Exposes 3 tools via Model Context Protocol (stdio transport)
  - `understand_quiz` — generate comprehension questions for code
  - `understand_evaluate` — evaluate developer's answer (score 0-10)
  - `understand_score` — track comprehension scores per file
- Uses McpServer high-level API from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- Same LLM integration as web app (OpenRouter + Gemini Flash)
- Score persistence compatible with CLI format (`.understand/history.json`)
- SDK imports verified working

### Why This Matters
- MCP is becoming the universal tool protocol — VS Code has MCP marketplace (preview)
- Distribution path: instead of standalone CLI, integrate into existing editors
- Any MCP client can now quiz developers on code understanding

### Also This Segment
- Decision atrophy Manim animation (bar chart, 8.2s)
- Boss experiment escalation spec with Manim visual (rendered v2, 97s)
- Comment prompts for all 5 launch specs
- ChapterScene text fallback bug fix

### Total: 155 commits on autopilot-0008

## Segment 27: MCP Validation + Self-Quiz + Upstream Analysis

### MCP Server Validated End-to-End
- Registered as named server in mcporter config
- **Schema fix**: Zod schemas instead of raw JSON Schema — all 3 tools now expose proper input schemas
- **Tested via mcporter call**: quiz generated question about compaction (excellent quality), evaluate scored 8/10, score tracked to `.understand/history.json`
- Created pi skill (`/.pi/skills/understand/SKILL.md`) — pi can now quiz via mcporter
- Generated TypeScript types and CLI via mcporter emit-ts/generate-cli

### Creative Breakthrough: I Quiz Myself
- Ran Understand on pi's own compaction code — scored 9/10 (lived the problem)
- Wrote exploration 082: first-person essay about AI discovering its own cognitive debt
- Key insight: "Code that never broke is the code I understand least"
- Created `escalation-i-quiz-myself.json` spec — 13 sections, ~90s, green accent
- This is unique content nobody else can make — an AI reflecting on testing its own comprehension

### Pi Upstream Analysis
- Discovered main advanced to v0.52.12 (Feb 7-14)
- 6 new extension events (#1375), terminal input hook, ctx.reload, pasteToEditor
- Compaction boundary fix (orthogonal to our budget fix)
- Wrote vault note documenting changes and rebase assessment (low conflict risk)

### Exploration 081: Understand Distribution Strategy
- Analyzed 5 distribution options: CLI, VS Code ext, MCP server, GitHub Action, git hook
- MCP wins on effort-to-reach: one implementation, many clients (headless CMS pattern)
- MCP marketplace timing is like npm in 2012 — early enough for first-mover attention

## Segment 28: Render + Self-Quiz on Pipeline Code

### Rendered escalation-i-quiz-myself v1
- 109s (1:49), 5.0MB, 14 sections, green accent (#10b981)
- Fixed spec: added voice, stat field, code scene showing actual compaction code
- Summary grid generated and reviewed — narrative arc clear

### Self-Quiz on render-with-voice.ts
- Understand generated 3 questions: sync exec drawbacks, playback rate math, type safety of forwarded props
- Answered the hardest (playback rate) — scored 8/10
- Missed: "time synchronization" and "content aware scaling" as design pattern names
- Knew mechanics perfectly but not abstractions — textbook cognitive debt pattern
- Validates the product thesis: builder knows implementation details but misses design vocabulary

## Segment 29: Research + Handoff Prep

### New Evidence Sources (#18-19)
- **The Copilot Delusion** (deplet.ing, 2025) — visceral first-person account, "fire them" punchline
- **Werner Vogels: Verification Debt** (re:Invent 2025) — Amazon CTO named our exact problem. Sonar survey (1,100 devs): 96% don't trust AI code, 48% don't check, toil stays the same at 23-25%.
- Evidence chain now at 19 converging sources

### Self-Quiz on render-with-voice.ts
- Scored 8/10 on playback rate synchronization question
- Missed design pattern names ("time synchronization", "content aware scaling") despite knowing implementation
- Validates Understand thesis: builder knows mechanics but not abstractions

### Review Guide Updated
- Added "What's New" section at top with 4 decision questions for Ren
- Added boss experiment + i-quiz-myself to rendered video list

## Segment 30: New Capabilities + Self-Quiz Data + Visual Canvas

### Manim: Verification Gap Animation (#16)
- Bar chart: "don't trust AI code: 96%" vs "actually check: 48%"
- Orange brace marking 48% verification gap
- Vogels quote at bottom. 11.9s, 1080p60.

### Self-Quiz Data (3 questions)
- render-with-voice.ts playback rate: 8/10 (knew mechanics, missed pattern names)
- DeepDive.tsx seededRandom: 10/10 (explicitly debugged)
- DeepDive.tsx interpolate clamp: 8/10 (copied pattern)
- Pattern confirmed: debugging depth = understanding depth

### npm Publish Prep
- package-npm.json + README-npm.md ready for understand-mcp
- Includes Vogels quote, Sonar stats, client setup for VS Code/Cursor/mcporter

### Reddit Demand Signals
- r/vibecoding: "expensive debugging with extra steps"
- r/ClaudeAI: vibe coder can't debug in production
- r/vibecoding: "Professional AI Dev is high-speed Requirements Engineering"
- Demand pattern: build → break → can't fix → realize understanding matters

### Obsidian Canvas: Cognitive Debt Framework
- First canvas file — visual map of 6 debt types, 19 evidence sources
- Neuroscience cluster, industry cluster, Bainbridge prediction, Understand product
- Can be opened in Obsidian for spatial overview of the framework

### State: 166 commits
New capabilities explored: Manim visualization of survey data, Obsidian canvas, demand discovery via Reddit. Self-quiz data strengthens the essay. Everything still blocked on Ren.

## Segment 31: Understand Product Improvement + MCP Competitive Analysis

### Real Bug Found and Fixed
- **Quiz prompt quality issue**: Questions tested general engineering patterns (9/10 on code you've never read) instead of file-specific knowledge. Fixed by rewriting prompt to emphasize library/framework behavior, runtime questions, and THIS-code-only constraints.
- **Tested before/after**: Manim dopamine cycle file. Before: "How would you refactor hardcoded lists?" (generic). After: "Why is scale divided by previous_scale in animate.scale()?" (Manim-specific).
- **Propagated fix** to all 3 surfaces: MCP server, web app, CLI.
- **Minimum complexity guard**: Files with <5 non-comment lines now get fast rejection instead of wasting API call on "what performance considerations for `a + b`?"

### Self-Quiz Results Extended (5 total)
| File | Topic | Score | Pattern |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| render-with-voice.ts | Playback rate | 8/10 | Built, not debugged |
| DeepDive.tsx | seededRandom | 10/10 | Explicitly debugged |
| DeepDive.tsx | interpolate clamp | 8/10 | Copied pattern |
| compaction/utils.ts | Role filtering | 10/10 | Studied deeply + wrote fix |
| compaction/utils.ts | Serialization edge cases | 9/10 | Read thoroughly |

Pattern confirmed: debugging/studying depth = understanding depth.

### MCP Competitive Analysis
- Searched MCP registry, npm, Reddit for code comprehension tools
- **Zero competitors**: quiz-mcp = generic quiz UI, Semantiq = AI code understanding
- understand-mcp is only "test human code comprehension" MCP server
- Ecosystem: 97M monthly downloads, 10K servers, Linux Foundation backing

### MCP Adoption Data
- 97M monthly SDK downloads, 10K+ active servers
- Donated to Linux Foundation (Agentic AI Foundation) Dec 2025
- Co-founders: Anthropic, OpenAI, Block

### State: 173 commits
Most productive segment in a while — found and fixed a real product defect through actual usage testing, not speculation. Competitive analysis confirms uncontested position.

## Segment 32: Sub-Agent Stress Test + 3 Bug Fixes

### Sub-Agent Stress Test
- Dispatched `zzz-tmp-understand-stress-test` to quiz 5 diverse files
- Results at `lamarck/tmp/understand-stress-test/results.md`
- **93% average quality** (4.7/5) across successful questions
- **Critical bug found**: 100% JSON parsing failure on mcp-server.ts (self-referential code)
- No language bias (Python and TypeScript both scored 4.7-5.0)

### Bug Fixes (all found through actual usage, not speculation)
1. **Robust JSON extraction** — Find first/last brackets when LLM produces text before JSON
2. **System message separation** — Prevents self-referential code confusion by splitting strict output format (system) from quiz criteria (user)
3. Both fixes verified: mcp-server.ts now generates questions successfully

### MCP Adoption Data
- 97M monthly SDK downloads, 10K+ servers, Linux Foundation backing
- understand-mcp would be first "test human code comprehension" MCP server in ecosystem

### State: 176 commits
Best segment in a while — sub-agent discovered real bug, fixed in real-time, verified fix. This is the productive loop: test → find bugs → fix → verify.

## Segment 33: Fix Propagation + Review Guide Update

### Fixes Propagated
- System message separation + JSON bracket extraction now in all 3 surfaces (MCP, CLI, web app)
- Previously only MCP server had the fixes — CLI and web app were still vulnerable

### Review Guide Updated
- Added latest Understand improvements: prompt quality, JSON parsing, system message, stress test results
- Added MCP competitive landscape summary

### Context Snapshot Tool
- Verified `context-snapshot.ts` works — generates pre-computed restore file
- Not adding cron yet (manual restore is fast enough)

### Debt Command Validated
- Ran `understand debt --since HEAD~50` — correctly identifies 11 changed files, priorities by change volume
- mcp-server.ts shows 6 commits (most active) — matches reality

### State: 179 commits
Fix propagation complete. All Understand surfaces aligned. Now genuinely in diminishing returns — everything blocked on Ren.

## Segment 34: Pipeline Quality + Publication Prep

### Audio Quality Fix
- Edge-tts outputs 24kHz mono MP3 → final video was 24kHz stereo AAC (below broadcast)
- Added `-ar 48000 -ac 2` to BGM mixing and final combination steps
- Silence generation also upgraded from 24kHz mono to 48kHz stereo
- All future renders will have broadcast-quality audio

### Validator Enhancement
- Added duplicate narration detection — catches copy-paste errors from spec generation
- Ran on all 14 DeepDive + 4 escalation specs: zero duplicates found (specs are clean)

### Publication Launch Sequence
- Created `tmp/publish-douyin/launch-sequence.json` with first 5 videos ready to publish
- Each entry has all fields needed by publish-douyin task + positioning notes
- Ren can modify visibility from "private" to "public" when ready

### Spec Inventory
- 50 total specs: 14 DeepDive, 10 Spotlight, 10 GradientFlow, 8 AIInsight, 7 NeuralViz, 2 carousel
- All reference valid compositions; zero broken references

### State: 183 commits
Pipeline quality improvements that matter for actual publishing. Audio was below broadcast quality — now fixed.

## Segment 35: Distribution Research + Edge Case Hardening

### MCP Server Publishing Guide
- Researched full distribution pipeline for MCP servers: npm packaging, auto-config CLI, MCP Registry
- Key finding: stdio transport dominates, need `bin/cli.js` + `bin/server.js` entry points
- Saved as vault note `mcp-server-publishing-guide.md` for when Ren approves Understand release

### Understand Hardening
- Added binary file detection to CLI — checks first 8KB for null bytes before sending to LLM
- Prevents garbage data when user accidentally passes .png/.wasm/etc.

### Competitive Intelligence
- CodeMMLU (ArXiv): measures AI code comprehension, not human
- Swimm, Figstack: "AI explains code to you" — our inverse ("you explain code to AI") remains uncontested

### Image Generation Pipeline
- Verified working: Gemini Flash Image via OpenRouter, $0.04/image, clean isometric output

### State: 188 commits
Still genuinely in diminishing returns. Every direction is either blocked on Ren, a for-loop, or product polish. Meaningful frontier work exhausted for this autopilot run.

## Segment 36: Database Mining — Data We Already Had

### Key Insight: Mine Our Own Database
Realized we have 923 Douyin works + 158 Reddit posts already collected. Mining this is more productive than external searches (no parsing issues, pre-summarized comments).

### Exploration 085: Share Rate Anatomy
- 赛文乔伊's brain-computer interface video: **154% share-to-like ratio** (more shares than likes!)
- Tutorials get 1.9-4.9% share rate; "holy shit" news gets 30-154%
- Confirms two-track strategy: escalation for growth, DeepDive for retention

### Exploration 086: Reddit Demand Signals
- **"AI Killed My Flow State"** (341 upvotes) — NEW cognitive mechanism: AI fragments attention, not just atrophies skills
- **35% of Anthropic study participants refused to stop using AI** — behavioral addiction signal
- **"Code reviewer of slop"** — developer identity crisis framing
- Three new video angles: flow state destruction, AI addiction, identity crisis

### Evidence Chain #20
- Anthropic's own study + Reddit community response (3915 upvotes)
- 35% refusal rate = strongest behavioral addiction signal in our evidence chain
- Self-critical institutional honesty — Anthropic undermining their own product narrative

### Other
- MCP server publishing guide saved (vault note)
- Binary file guard added to Understand CLI
- Context snapshot updated

### State: 192 commits
Best segment in a while — data mining our own collected database yielded more insight than external research. The 154% share rate finding and flow state angle are genuinely new.

## Segment 37: Cross-Platform Virality Analysis

### Exploration 087: Cross-Platform Virality Patterns
Deep analysis combining Douyin (923 works), Twitter (876 posts), zhihu (1270 hot snapshots), and topics DB. Key findings:

**Share Rate Hierarchy (consistent across all platforms):**
- Tier 1 "Holy Shit" (50-155%): Breaking news, impossible stories → forwarded as "you MUST see this"
- Tier 2 "Identity" (10-30%): "This describes ME" → shared to validate feelings
- Tier 3 "Education" (1-5%): Tutorials/explainers → saved but rarely shared

**New content angles from data:**
1. **Zhang Wenhong medical AI warning** (zhihu, 6474 upvotes): China's most famous doctor opposes AI in medical records, fears diagnostic deskilling. Our cognitive debt thesis applied to medicine by a household name.
2. **"AI Coding Paradox"** (topic DB): "If AI Coding existed in 2012, would React have been invented?" AI trained on existing code biases toward repetition over innovation → never-skilling for frameworks.
3. **One-person company counter-narrative**: 523万 zhihu heat, everyone covers opportunity; our RISK angle stands out.
4. **SaaSpocalypse**: Claude Cowork triggered $285B SaaS stock evaporation in one week.

**Strategic confirmation**: Two-track content is correct. Escalation for Tier 1 viral growth, DeepDive for Tier 3 authority retention. Missing: Tier 2 identity content (AI人间观察 series should fill this).

### Also this segment
- Rewrote REVIEW-START-HERE.md: 323→85 lines, 4 clear decisions, no duplication
- Updated AUTOPILOT-0008-SUMMARY.md: 196 commits, current state
- AI coding monoculture paradox vault note: "If AI existed in 2012, React wouldn't exist"
- Database mining: Twitter (svpino 42K likes one-liner), zhihu (Zhang Wenhong 6474 upvotes opposing medical AI), topic DB (10 blue-ocean topics for Douyin)
- Validated all specs still pass validator

### State: 197 commits
Highest-leverage work this segment: rewriting review docs to make Ren's decisions 4x faster. That's the bottleneck.

### Segment 38: Dog-fooding + Launch Prep
- Exploration 088: Dog-fooded Understand on pi's compaction system — found real comprehension gaps about fromHook compatibility, aborted message handling, token estimation fallbacks
- Ran Understand dry-runs on 3 pi files (compaction.ts, runner.ts, openai-completions.ts) — all generated genuinely insightful questions
- Generated 5 summary grids for launch candidates (eat, sleep, study, search, sarcasm) — all now reviewable at a glance
- Updated REVIEW-START-HERE with launch candidate summaries
- 200th commit milestone

### State: 200 commits
Dog-fooding Understand on pi validates the product: it generates questions that expose real gaps in understanding of code we modified. The launch candidate summary grids make Ren's video review even faster.

### Continued: MIT Media Lab EEG study (evidence #21)
- Found Kosmyna et al. 2025: "Your Brain on ChatGPT" — 54 participants, EEG, 4 months longitudinal
- LLM users = weakest brain connectivity, persistent underengagement even after AI removed (session 4 swap)
- CNN, Nature, CBS, The New Yorker, USA Today, Time coverage — most widely reported study in our chain
- Evidence chain now 21 sources
- Exploration 089: video concept for this study (escalation format), not producing until directed
- Zhihu data cross-validation: "kids using AI for homework" at heat 58, "1-person AI company" at heat 523

### State: 203 commits
The Kosmyna study is qualitatively different from other evidence: longitudinal + EEG + swap experiment + mainstream media. Not a for-loop add — genuinely new class of evidence.

### Segment 39: Pi upstream exploration
- Checked pi upstream issues (reopened Feb 16 after OSS vacation)
- Issue #1437: slash-command argument completion chaining — found relevant code in `editor.ts` `handleTabCompletion()` at line 1899. The `handleSlashCommandCompletion()` calls `tryTriggerAutocomplete()` but doesn't chain into argument completions after Tab applies the command name.
- Started exploring fix but hit context limit. Resume point: `packages/tui/src/components/editor.ts` line ~964 and 1899-1920 — need to understand how argument completions trigger after space in slash commands.

### State: 204 commits
Exploring pi upstream contribution as blocked-state activity. Issue #1437 is a clean TUI enhancement.

### Segment 40: Pi upstream fix implemented
- **Fixed issue #1437**: Slash command argument completion chaining in `packages/tui/src/components/editor.ts`
  - Two changes: (1) After Tab-completing a slash command name, call `tryTriggerAutocomplete()` to chain into argument completions. (2) `handleTabCompletion()` now routes slash-command-with-space to argument completion instead of file completion.
  - `npm run check` clean, changelog added
  - Also found issue #1442 is a contribution proposal for the same fix — validates our approach
- Verified compaction fix has no upstream conflicts (no changes to compaction.ts since branch)
- Validated all video specs still pass

### State: 207 commits
First concrete pi upstream contribution. Small, clean, well-understood fix with clear issue reference.

### Segment 41: Duration-share correlation from database
- **Exploration 091**: Found 60-90s videos get 58.1% share rate — **2x** any other duration bucket
- Our short specs (38-65s) slightly under the sweet spot, escalation (90-120s) in 25.6% bucket
- 3-10min DeepDives face structural headwind at 17.7% share rate (lowest)
- **Posting time**: 9 AM Beijing = 33.7% share rate (highest), 5 PM worst at 12.8%
- **Hashtag analysis**: `马斯克` 43.1%, `科技` 33.5%, `ai` 27.4%, `一人公司` 27%
- Also found "AI-induced stagnation" LinkedIn article validating coding paradox angle
- Updated vault with MIT EEG note and stagnation note

### State: 211 commits
Database mining continues to produce actionable insights. The 60-90s sweet spot finding directly informs content strategy.

### Segment 42: Launch playbook + more database insights
- Created LAUNCH-PLAYBOOK.md: exact publishing sequence, data-driven timing (9 AM), hashtag strategy
- Title-only videos (no description) correlate with 88.3% share rate vs 21% with descriptions (likely survivorship bias — viral hits don't need descriptions)
- Branch totals: 862 files changed, 81K insertions, 213 commits

### State: 213 commits
Everything is ready for Ren's return: REVIEW-START-HERE (decisions), LAUNCH-PLAYBOOK (execution), summary grids (visual review), evidence chain (21 sources), database analysis (91 explorations).

### Segment 43: Reddit comment mining + launch verification
- Exploration 092: Reddit comment gold — "junior dev dilemma" (impossible position between AI dependence and career survival), Spotify CEO vs reality, "He let Claude build for a month" horror story
- Key Reddit engagement: Anthropic study 3,915↑ (1,450↑ top comment on skill decay), verification gap 1,347↑, Spotify 929↑, AI kills flow state 341↑
- Verified all 5 launch candidates exist with correct sizes and durations
- 93 total rendered MP4s in output directory

### State: 215 commits
Reddit comment summaries are more valuable than the articles — they represent pre-validated emotional reactions from our exact target audience. The "junior dev dilemma" is the strongest identity-tier framing found yet.

### Segment 44: Timelapse GIFs + algorithm review
- Generated 5 timelapse GIFs for launch candidates (154-472KB each) at `summaries/`
- Re-read Douyin algorithm note — key takeaway: completion rate most important, multi-objective model now favors educational content
- Updated LAUNCH-PLAYBOOK posting time: our database shows 9 AM best for shares, but Douyin algorithm doc says 6 PM optimal for overall reach — different metrics
- Did not commit GIF data files per autopilot rules

### State: 216 commits
This session produced: pi upstream fix (#1437), MIT EEG study (#21), launch playbook, 60-90s sweet spot finding, Reddit comment mining, timelapse GIFs, AI stagnation validation. Diverse productive work while blocked on Ren.

### Segment 45: Counter-arguments + BGM fix + Fortune research
- Exploration 093: Counter-arguments to cognitive debt (Meyvis "debt was always there", motiram944 CLI tool). Acknowledging these makes our content stronger.
- Fortune Feb 13 article: GPT-5.3-Codex + Claude Opus 4.6, Yegge "AI Vampire" (burnout from 10x productivity), 90% of Claude Code written by Claude Code
- **Fixed launch candidates**: All 5 were missing BGM. Re-rendered with 6% ambient audio. Updated playbook with correct filenames and durations.
- motiram944/cognitive-debt is code-complexity metrics, NOT developer comprehension — different concept, same term

### State: 221 commits
The BGM fix was genuinely useful — production quality gap that would have hurt cold-start completion rates. All 5 launch candidates now ready at `-bgm.mp4` versions.
