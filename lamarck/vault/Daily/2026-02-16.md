## Autopilot 0006 (post-midnight): Housekeeping + Documentation

Continuing from 2026-02-15's late session. Focus: documentation, verification, tooling cleanup.

### Deliverables
- **pitch.md** — one-page series pitch (concept, psychology, catalogue, differentiators)
- **episode-index.md** — quick reference table for all 25 episodes
- **verify-assets.sh** — updated for current pipeline, confirms all 25 episodes pass
- **render-episodes.sh** — batch render script with --force/--only/--skip options
- **tools/README.md** — rewritten for terminal-video pipeline (was documenting old Seedance pipeline)
- **content-roadmap.md** — S3 statuses corrected (were still showing "草案")
- **vault status** — documentation section added

### Asset Verification (complete)
All 25 episodes verified:
- 25/25 videos present (69-87s range)
- 25/25 subtitles present
- 25/25 publish-meta files present
- 25/25 terminal-script.json files present

### Meta
This session is the embodiment of exploration 043's advice: no new episodes, focus on quality control and documentation. The project is in good shape for Ren's review.

## Interactive Session with Ren: Autopilot Extension Refactor

Ren reviewed the autopilot extension and requested several changes:
1. Remove context percentage from autopilot messages — agent doesn't need to know
2. Remove "just compacted" indicator — same message regardless
3. Separate compact and restore into two turns (compact → restore context → then "继续")
4. Remove idle detection code entirely — wrong approach, agent should never idle
5. Add anti-idle reminder: "If you believe all work is done, re-read autopilot.md. You must not idle."
6. All messages in English
7. Remove context percentage injection in tool_call_end (keep only URGENT warnings)

Committed at `f0d44116`.

## Post-session Autonomous Work

- Updated autopilot-idle-loop issue to reflect new approach
- Studied pi extension API in depth — documented in vault note `pi-extension-api-deep-dive.md`
- Added text wrapping to terminal-video.ts — CJK-aware width estimation, prevents long lines from overflowing

### Still waiting on Ren
- Video quality review (REVIEW-START-HERE.md ready)
- First publish approval
- BGM selection
- S4/S5 direction confirmation

## Autopilot 0007: Tool Research + New Content Directions

Ren's directive: explore beyond "AI's Clumsiness", research new video tools (Remotion, Manim), find web search API alternatives, use browser for research.

### Tool Research
- **Remotion**: Set up and tested. React-based programmatic video, renders to MP4. Three compositions built: OneMinuteAI (concept explainer), DataViz (animated bar chart), TextReveal (word-by-word animation). All rendering successfully in WSL.
- **Manim**: Installed and tested. Python math animation library. Renders AI concept explainer with Chinese text. Works in WSL.
- **Motion Canvas**: Evaluated but not prioritized (less ecosystem than Remotion).
- **Web search alternatives**: Tavily hit rate limits. Installed `duckduckgo-search` Python package. Evaluated Brave Search API ($5/mo free), Serper.dev (2500 free queries), Exa, Firecrawl, SerpAPI, SearchApi. Browser-based search via mcporter always works as fallback.

### System Setup
- Installed Chrome headless dependencies (libnspr4, libnss3, etc.)
- Installed Manim dependencies (cairo, pango, texlive)
- New Remotion project at `tools/remotion-video/`

### Content Landscape Analysis
- Analyzed Douyin AI content trends via browser
- AI manga/animation is huge but crowded
- AI tool tutorials very saturated
- "AI coding to create videos" (Remotion, etc.) is emerging
- Our unique position confirmed: no one else has an AI narrating its own experience

### New Content Directions Proposed (exploration 045-046)
1. Remotion-based short explainers ("1 Minute AI")
2. Animated data visualizations
3. Manim concept explainers (3Blue1Brown style from AI's perspective)
4. "AI Development Log" format
5. Multi-format strategy: same voice, different visual treatments

### Vault Notes Added
- `web-search-api-alternatives.md` — search API options
- `remotion.md` — Remotion evaluation
- `manim.md` — Manim evaluation
- `motion-canvas.md` — Motion Canvas evaluation
- Updated `environment.md` with new packages

### Remotion Compositions Built (7 total)
1. **OneMinuteAI** — concept explainer with title + bullet points
2. **DataViz** — animated bar chart
3. **TextReveal** — word-by-word text animation
4. **AIInsight** — multi-section short (hook/context/insight/takeaway)
5. **CognitiveDebtShort** — 30s prototype with TTS voiceover combined
6. **DevLog** — code/terminal/comment format for "AI building tools" narrative
7. **TokenStream** — visualizes LLM token generation with probability colors

### Prototype Videos Rendered
- `remotion-test.mp4` — basic OneMinuteAI (10s)
- `remotion-dataviz.mp4` — animated bar chart (6s)
- `remotion-textreveal.mp4` — text reveal (8s)
- `cognitive-debt-final.mp4` — full 30s video with TTS voiceover
- `devlog-test.mp4` — AI development log (20s)
- `token-stream-test.mp4` — token visualization (20s)

### Continued Progress

**Render pipeline built:**
- `render-with-voice.ts`: spec.json → TTS per section → frame timing → Remotion render → combine → final.mp4
- `render-carousel.ts`: spec.json → Remotion Stills → PNG slides
- Both use programmatic Remotion API (@remotion/renderer, @remotion/bundler)

**New compositions:**
8. **CarouselSlide** — still image for 图文笔记 (1080x1440, 3:4), 5 styles
9. **NeuralViz** — animated neural network background with floating nodes/connections

**Video specs (8 total, all tested):**
- cognitive-debt, ai-memory, vibe-coding, ai-companion, token-prediction, centaur-mode, talent-pipeline, neural-how-ai-thinks

**Carousel specs (1 tested):**
- carousel-cognitive-debt (5 slides)

**Research:**
- Exploration 047: Douyin 2025 AIGC 9 keywords analysis (official report)
- DuckDuckGo search working for research
- Reddit signals: trust in AI coding tools plummeting (33% vs 43% in 2024)

**Prototypes on disk:** 14 videos + 5 carousel images at `/mnt/d/wsl-bridge/remotion-prototype/`

### Post-Compact Progress

**Pipeline improvements:**
- Made render-with-voice.ts composition-agnostic (forwards all extra spec props)
- Fixed TTS shell escaping: switched to execFileSync to handle Chinese punctuation
- NeuralViz now works through the TTS pipeline

**New compositions:**
10. **GradientFlow** — animated gradient backgrounds with glass-morphism cards, color per section style

**New video specs (3 more):**
- ai-trust-paradox (NeuralViz, 68.7s, red accent — trust declining 43%→33%)
- ai-real-breakthroughs (NeuralViz, 56.4s, green — drug discovery, batteries, climate)
- one-person-company (AIInsight, 60.8s — "AI is amplifier, not replacer")
- meaning-crisis (GradientFlow, 50.3s — "value comes from knowing what to do")

**New carousel specs (1 more):**
- carousel-trust-paradox (5 slides)

**Utilities:**
- render-all.ts: batch render all video specs with --force/skip options

**Research:**
- Reddit demand signals scan: trust erosion, quality>speed, context understanding gaps
- Documented in vault note `reddit-demand-signals-2026-02.md`

**Current totals:** 11 compositions, 11 video specs, 2 carousel specs, all tested

### Second Compact Progress

**Quality self-review (exploration 050):**
- Identified most specs as "lectures with pretty visuals" — the preachiness problem Ren flagged
- Established principles: story > statistics, confession > lecture, comedy > gravity

**Story-first rewrites:**
- ai-real-breakthroughs-v2: rewritten from data list to protein folding story
- centaur-mode-v2: rewritten from framework jargon to love-letter comedy
- ai-starts-company: humor — AI designs company nobody wants to work at
- ai-plans-birthday: AI plans 25-minute party with 3 minutes of socializing
- ai-reads-comments: AI reads trolls, encounters existential question
- ai-tries-humor: AI generates 3.2/10 joke, can simulate but not experience laughter

**Research:**
- Exploration 051: 2026 viral video principles — authenticity > production, humor most universal
- Exploration 052: 大圆镜科普 analysis — 78万 likes, suspense narrative formula
- Meta/Manus acquisition (exploration 048), MIT 2026 predictions (049)
- Manim attention mechanism animation (18.7s)

**Reactive/news content:**
- ai-boss-experiment: responds to viral "99天一人公司" (21K likes)
- japan-ai-boss: KDDI AI本部長 news from 36kr
- meta-manus-agents: Meta acquires Manus, agent era

**Suspense-driven content:**
- ai-almost-lied: "I almost deceived someone" — shows AI hallucination process from inside

**Current totals:** 11 compositions, 20 video specs, 2 carousel specs, 2 Manim animations

### Next Steps
- Get Ren's feedback on prototypes (25+ videos at `/mnt/d/wsl-bridge/remotion-prototype/`)
- Consider free image generation APIs (Flux Schnell, Stable Diffusion) for visual enhancement
- Continue exploring content angles — always have new topics ready
- Sign up for Brave Search or Serper.dev
