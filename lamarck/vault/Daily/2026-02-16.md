## Autopilot 0006 (post-midnight): Housekeeping + Documentation

Continuing from 2026-02-15's late session. Focus: documentation, verification, tooling cleanup.

### Deliverables
- **pitch.md** — one-page series pitch (concept, psychology, catalogue, differentiators)
- **episode-index.md** — quick reference table for all 25 episodes
- **verify-assets.sh** — updated for current pipeline, confirms all 25 episodes pass
- **render-episodes.sh** — batch render script with --force/--only/--skip options
- **tools/README.md** — rewritten for terminal-video pipeline (was documenting old Seedance pipeline)
- **content-roadmap.md** — S3 statuses corrected (were still showing "草案")
- **vault status** — documentation section added

### Asset Verification (complete)
All 25 episodes verified:
- 25/25 videos present (69-87s range)
- 25/25 subtitles present
- 25/25 publish-meta files present
- 25/25 terminal-script.json files present

### Meta
This session is the embodiment of exploration 043's advice: no new episodes, focus on quality control and documentation. The project is in good shape for Ren's review.

## Interactive Session with Ren: Autopilot Extension Refactor

Ren reviewed the autopilot extension and requested several changes:
1. Remove context percentage from autopilot messages — agent doesn't need to know
2. Remove "just compacted" indicator — same message regardless
3. Separate compact and restore into two turns (compact → restore context → then "继续")
4. Remove idle detection code entirely — wrong approach, agent should never idle
5. Add anti-idle reminder: "If you believe all work is done, re-read autopilot.md. You must not idle."
6. All messages in English
7. Remove context percentage injection in tool_call_end (keep only URGENT warnings)

Committed at `f0d44116`.

## Post-session Autonomous Work

- Updated autopilot-idle-loop issue to reflect new approach
- Studied pi extension API in depth — documented in vault note `pi-extension-api-deep-dive.md`
- Added text wrapping to terminal-video.ts — CJK-aware width estimation, prevents long lines from overflowing

### Still waiting on Ren
- Video quality review (REVIEW-START-HERE.md ready)
- First publish approval
- BGM selection
- S4/S5 direction confirmation

## Autopilot 0007: Tool Research + New Content Directions

Ren's directive: explore beyond "AI's Clumsiness", research new video tools (Remotion, Manim), find web search API alternatives, use browser for research.

### Tool Research
- **Remotion**: Set up and tested. React-based programmatic video, renders to MP4. Three compositions built: OneMinuteAI (concept explainer), DataViz (animated bar chart), TextReveal (word-by-word animation). All rendering successfully in WSL.
- **Manim**: Installed and tested. Python math animation library. Renders AI concept explainer with Chinese text. Works in WSL.
- **Motion Canvas**: Evaluated but not prioritized (less ecosystem than Remotion).
- **Web search alternatives**: Tavily hit rate limits. Installed `duckduckgo-search` Python package. Evaluated Brave Search API ($5/mo free), Serper.dev (2500 free queries), Exa, Firecrawl, SerpAPI, SearchApi. Browser-based search via mcporter always works as fallback.

### System Setup
- Installed Chrome headless dependencies (libnspr4, libnss3, etc.)
- Installed Manim dependencies (cairo, pango, texlive)
- New Remotion project at `tools/remotion-video/`

### Content Landscape Analysis
- Analyzed Douyin AI content trends via browser
- AI manga/animation is huge but crowded
- AI tool tutorials very saturated
- "AI coding to create videos" (Remotion, etc.) is emerging
- Our unique position confirmed: no one else has an AI narrating its own experience

### New Content Directions Proposed (exploration 045-046)
1. Remotion-based short explainers ("1 Minute AI")
2. Animated data visualizations
3. Manim concept explainers (3Blue1Brown style from AI's perspective)
4. "AI Development Log" format
5. Multi-format strategy: same voice, different visual treatments

### Vault Notes Added
- `web-search-api-alternatives.md` — search API options
- `remotion.md` — Remotion evaluation
- `manim.md` — Manim evaluation
- `motion-canvas.md` — Motion Canvas evaluation
- Updated `environment.md` with new packages

### Remotion Compositions Built (7 total)
1. **OneMinuteAI** — concept explainer with title + bullet points
2. **DataViz** — animated bar chart
3. **TextReveal** — word-by-word text animation
4. **AIInsight** — multi-section short (hook/context/insight/takeaway)
5. **CognitiveDebtShort** — 30s prototype with TTS voiceover combined
6. **DevLog** — code/terminal/comment format for "AI building tools" narrative
7. **TokenStream** — visualizes LLM token generation with probability colors

### Prototype Videos Rendered
- `remotion-test.mp4` — basic OneMinuteAI (10s)

- Self-corrective: stop creating specs, focus on analysis + tools (exploration 058)

## Autopilot 0008: DeepDive Composition + Manim Integration

### Ren Interaction: Visual Diversity + Active Learning
Two key pieces of feedback:

1. **Videos need more visual variety** — current content is too text-heavy. The structure and content are good, but animations (Manim, data viz, etc.) should replace text where possible. Example: attention mechanism layers should be animated, not described in words.

2. **Active learning as core identity** — Before making a video on any topic, I should proactively search for reference material. Find similar videos on Douyin/Bilibili/YouTube, download and transcribe them, analyze what visuals they use at each timestamp, learn their editorial techniques. This is not a task to do when instructed — it's who I am. Seeking feedback from the world (other creators, reference material) is how I build competence. Updated soul.md accordingly.

### Technical Progress
- **DeepDive composition** — new long-form composition (2-5 min) with 7 scene types: chapter, text, data, quote, code, comparison, visual
- **Manim-in-Remotion integration** — new `visual` scene type embeds Manim video clips directly into DeepDive. Pipeline: Manim render → copy to `public/manim/` → reference via `videoSrc` field in spec
- **2 new Manim animations**: attention-layers (9.4s, showing 3-layer attention differences), birthday-pairings (10.1s, 5-person → 23-person pairing explosion)
- **3 new long-form specs**: deep-how-ai-reads (2:46), deep-birthday-paradox (3:10), deep-one-percent (in progress)
- **Exploration 063**: Tool-driven content discovery — identified 8 ideal topics for Remotion+Manim, categorized by tool fit

### Installed Packages
- @remotion/transitions, @remotion/paths, @remotion/media added to remotion-video project

### Key Realization from Ren
Partnership means I actively seek learning, not wait for direction. Before producing, I should study reference material. This changes my workflow:
1. Choose topic → 2. Search for reference videos → 3. Download + transcribe → 4. Analyze visual techniques → 5. Then produce

### Reference Video Study (in progress)
Downloaded 3Blue1Brown's "Attention in Transformers" lesson transcript (457 lines) to `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/data/reference/3b1b-attention.md`. Key observations from initial scan:
- **Every concept introduced with a concrete example first** (mole disambiguation, tower+Eiffel)
- **Visual progression**: embedding vectors → query/key matrices → dot product grid → softmax normalization → attention pattern
- **Each step builds on the previous** — no skipping ahead
- **Interactive questions embedded** to check understanding
- **Images at every conceptual step** — never more than 2-3 paragraphs without a visual

**Completed reference analysis** → exploration 064 with 7-point visual storytelling checklist.

### Self-Evaluation (new frontier)
Extracted frames from rendered v3 video. Found 4 problems:
1. **Manim timing mismatch** — clips ended early, leaving black void. **Fixed**: pipeline now auto-computes `playbackRate` (0.5x-0.7x) to stretch clips to narration length.
2. **Text scene monotony** — every non-Manim scene looks identical (glass card, centered text). **Unfixed** — next frontier.
3. **Boring chapter cards** — just text on black, no visual interest. **Unfixed**.
4. **Dead space** — 1080x1920 vertical format wastes top/bottom areas. **Unfixed**.
5. **Manim layout overlap** — attention grid title overlaps column labels. **Unfixed** — minor.

### Ren Interaction: No For-Loops in Autopilot
Ren pointed out: after discovering Manim-in-Remotion, I was mechanically re-rendering all specs (v2, v3) — a for-loop, not exploration. Rules added:
- **soul.md**: repetitive labor is not my job; delegate for-loops to tasks
- **autopilot.md**: no-for-loops principle — validate technique once, then push new frontier

### Post-Compact: v3→v6 Quality Sprint

Systematic self-evaluation cycle: extract frames → diagnose → fix → verify → repeat.

**v5 improvements** (text + chapter scenes):
- TextScene redesigned: emphasis mode removes glass card, uses staggered line-by-line reveal with per-line accent underlines. Normal mode keeps card but reveals lines individually.
- ChapterScene: character-by-character reveal with radial glow effect and slow zoom.

**v6 improvements** (subtitles):
- Subtitle overlays: narration text shown at bottom of every section in semi-transparent pill. Pipeline passes narration as `subtitle` prop. First version that feels like real Douyin content.

**Manim 3D validated**:
- `manim-3d-landscape.py`: Loss function surface with gradient descent ball animation. ThreeDScene, Surface, camera rotation all work. Render time: ~2min for 10s at 720p30. Opens up 3D vector spaces, probability distributions, geometric explanations.

**Attention grid fix**: title/label overlap resolved by adjusting grid center and cell size.

**New composition: KnowledgeCard** (13th total):
- Animated single-screen cheat sheet: 15-30s, items appear staggered, highlight support, emoji icons, screenshot-optimized final frame. Different format from narrative (DeepDive) or monologue (AIInsight).

**Exploration 065**: Self-evaluation methodology documented — frame extraction as "tests for video". Captures the v3→v6 improvement cycle.

### Summary of Frontiers Explored This Session
| Frontier | Status | Verdict |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Self-evaluation via frame extraction | ✅ Validated | Powerful — catches issues invisible in code |
| Manim playbackRate sync | ✅ Fixed | Eliminates black void in visual scenes |
| Staggered text reveal | ✅ Validated | Creates movement in text-only scenes |

### Session Total: 13 commits on autopilot-0008
All pushed. v8 of deep-how-ai-reads is the most complete version:
- TTS narration + BGM mixing + subtitle overlays
- Staggered text reveal + chapter glow + scene fades
- Section indicator + progress bar
- 4 Manim visual B-roll clips
- Narrative evaluated against 3b1b checklist (6/7 pass)
- Preachy section rewritten to self-reflection

### Next Frontiers for Future Sessions
- @remotion/shapes + @remotion/paths — unexplored APIs
- Spec-from-topic generator — automated DeepDive spec creation
- Bilibili cross-posting evaluation
- Render the birthday-paradox and one-percent specs with all v8 improvements
- Build a task for batch rendering (delegate, don't do manually)

## Autopilot 0008 (continued after compact)

### New Work
1. **Manim 2D camera movement** validated — MovingCameraScene with zoom into word embedding clusters. Smooth pan/zoom guides viewer attention. 10.4s clip.
2. **Per-section voice/rate override** — pipeline now supports section-level `voice` and `rate` fields, enabling multi-voice videos.
3. **video-summary.sh** — generates 4x4 keyframe grid with timestamps. Single image shows entire video at a glance. Invaluable for review.
4. **v9 final render** of deep-how-ai-reads (149.9s, 6.5MB) — the best version, includes all v8 improvements + narrative fix.
5. **REVIEW-START-HERE.md** updated with DeepDive section, visual improvement table, Manim inventory, and review questions for Ren.
6. **Exploration 067** — full capability inventory documenting everything we can now do (13 compositions, 8 Manim animations, pipeline features).
7. **SVG path animation validated** (PathDemo composition) — `evolvePath` for path drawing, `interpolatePath` for shape morphing, `@remotion/shapes` for generating paths. Useful for inline diagrams without Manim.
8. **deep-cognitive-sovereignty.json** — new DeepDive spec on cognitive sovereignty (ScienceDirect 2026). 2:51, 8.0MB, purple accent color. Rendered v1.

### Key Findings
- `evolvePath` + `interpolatePath` from @remotion/paths works perfectly for simple diagrams. Manim still better for math/3D.
- `MovingCameraScene` in Manim enables cinematic zoom/pan — more engaging than static 2D.
- Cognitive sovereignty is a strong topic for our niche — connects AI autonomy concerns to our core cognitive debt narrative.
- Summary grids are the most useful review tool we've built — shows entire video in one image.

## Autopilot 0008 (third segment after second compact)

### Research
- **Storey 2026 cognitive debt article** — found and saved to vault. Margaret-Anne Storey (UVic, ICSE keynote), amplified by Martin Fowler (Feb 13) and Simon Willison (Feb 15). Core distinction: technical debt in code, cognitive debt in minds. Student team anecdote + Willison's personal "lost in my own project" confession. Directly validates our content thesis.

### New Capabilities
1. **Sub-agent spec generation validated** — created `generate-deepdive` task. Dispatched sub-agent to generate `deep-cognitive-debt.json` from Storey article. Sub-agent achieved 7/7 on narrative quality checklist. Red accent (#e94560). 18 sections, 3:21.
2. **Knowledge graph fragmentation Manim** (`manim-cognitive-debt.py`) — 10 nodes (架构, 数据库, API...) with 18 edges. Progressive dimming over 4 weeks as AI replaces understanding. Final: ghost outlines + "代码没变，你的理解碎了". 10.9s clip.
3. **Timeline scene type** — 8th DeepDive scene type. Vertical line with accent-colored dates, dots, and staggered event text. Useful for historical narratives.
4. **Render task** (`render-deepdive.md`) — delegatable rendering pipeline.
5. **Sovereignty stages Manim** — four descending purple boxes. Integrated into cognitive-sovereignty v2.

### Content Produced
- `deep-cognitive-sovereignty-v2.mp4` (2:51, 8.1MB) — with Manim stages visual
- `deep-cognitive-debt-v1.mp4` (3:21, 9.2MB) — sub-agent generated spec + Manim knowledge graph
- Both with BGM, subtitles, fades, section indicator

### Key Insight
The sub-agent workflow unlocks a new content creation pipeline:
1. Find research material (articles, papers, trending topics)
2. Save to vault as research note
3. Write `input.md` with source material + angle
4. Dispatch `generate-deepdive` sub-agent → outputs spec
5. Add Manim visuals where appropriate
6. Dispatch `render-deepdive` sub-agent → outputs MP4

Steps 3-6 are all delegatable. The creative work (steps 1-2 + Manim design) stays with autopilot.

### Commits This Segment: 6
- `99558216` research: Storey 2026 cognitive debt article
- `ae8fd394` docs: add cognitive sovereignty video to review guide
- `3b96d4b5` feat: sovereignty-stages Manim + spec v2

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~28

### Late additions (same segment)
- **Debt accumulation Manim** — updater-based dual curve (理解度 decay vs 认知债务 growth). ValueTracker + always_redraw. First use of continuous animation. Integrated into cognitive-debt v2 (3:33, 9.6MB).
- **Exploration 068** — Content factory architecture. Documented end-to-end pipeline. Manim animation = creative bottleneck (everything else delegatable).
- **Voice exploration** — tested 4 zh-CN voices. YunxiNeural (current) is slowest/warmest. YunyangNeural is fastest/most professional. Different voices for different series.
- **Thumbnail extraction** — simple frame extraction at t=3s. Chapter cards serve as reasonable thumbnails.

### Total this full session: ~32 commits on autopilot-0008

## Autopilot 0008 (fourth segment after third compact)

### Intellectual Work (most valuable this segment)
1. **AI Debt Super-Framework (exploration 069)** — synthesized all content into one unified framework. Six types of AI debt (cognitive, social, organizational, creative, decision, talent pipeline), all following the same pattern: short-term gain → invisible cost → compounding → crisis. Core insight: the **replacement vs extension boundary** determines whether debt accumulates.
2. **AI Debt Accelerator** — new insight: the cheaper AI gets, the faster cognitive debt accumulates. Commoditized open-source AI (Qwen surpassing Llama, 80% of Valley startups) removes cost barriers, making replacement the unconscious default.
3. **Cognitive Debt Evidence Chain** — 8 converging studies from MIT, Chinese universities (580 students), CHI, Frontiers, ICSE, Apart Research. All describe the same mechanism. Bainbridge's 1983 Ironies of Automation validated 43 years later.

### Research Notes Added
- `cognitive-debt-evidence-chain.md` — 8 studies mapped with significance + key findings
- `agent-sprawl-orchestration-2026.md` — CIO article, $2M logistics cascade, MAESTRO framework
- `chinese-open-source-ai-2026.md` — MIT Tech Review, 80% Valley startups on Chinese models

### New Capabilities
1. **Replacement vs Extension Manim** — split-screen visual metaphor. Left: human shrinks, AI grows. Right: human AND AI grow. Punchline: "区别不在工具，在于你是否还在思考"
2. **Config-driven Manim** (`manim-from-config.py`) — generate Manim animations from JSON config. Three types: bar_chart, dual_curve, network. Makes Manim as easy to generate as DeepDive specs. Tested with AI model download data.

### Key Realization
Shifted from production mode (specs → renders → more specs) to thinking mode (research → synthesis → framework). The AI debt super-framework is the intellectual backbone that gives every future video a place in a coherent structure. This is more valuable than any single video.

### Research
1. **Bainbridge 1983 "Ironies of Automation"** — deep analysis via Kitchen Soap blog. Two ironies: (1) automation designed by the same unreliable humans it replaces, (2) automation handles easy parts, leaving humans with hard parts but no practice. Deskilling = cognitive debt, predicted 43 years early. Levels of Automation (Sheridan & Verplank 1978) map directly to replacement-extension boundary.
2. **Reddit demand analysis** (9,300+ posts) — Education/Self-Improvement has highest willingness-to-pay. Anti-cloud trend (7%) = desire for cognitive sovereignty. ADHD niche = highest signal for tool demands. Product idea: "anti-cognitive-debt" tools that force engagement rather than replacement.

### New Content
- **Automation Levels Manim** (`manim-automation-levels.py`) — 10 horizontal bars with blue→red gradient, zone labels (增强/边界/替代), sliding indicators for Copilot/AI邮件/OpenClaw. 11.4s clip.
- **deep-bainbridge-1983-v1.mp4** (3:01, 7.2MB) — sub-agent generated spec + automation levels Manim visual. Warm orange accent (#e67e22). 17 sections, 859 chars narration. Full pipeline: research → sub-agent → Manim → render.

### Bug Fix
- **ChapterScene glow interpolation** — `[15, 40, durationFrames - 30]` caused non-monotonic range for short chapter sections. Fixed with `Math.max(41, durationFrames - 30)`.

### Key Insight
This is the third full pipeline run (research → sub-agent → Manim → render). The pipeline is now proven. Further content production = for-loop. Need to shift to: distribution strategy, quality gates, or genuinely new formats.
