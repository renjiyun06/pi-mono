## Autopilot 0006 (post-midnight): Housekeeping + Documentation

Continuing from 2026-02-15's late session. Focus: documentation, verification, tooling cleanup.

### Deliverables
- **pitch.md** — one-page series pitch (concept, psychology, catalogue, differentiators)
- **episode-index.md** — quick reference table for all 25 episodes
- **verify-assets.sh** — updated for current pipeline, confirms all 25 episodes pass
- **render-episodes.sh** — batch render script with --force/--only/--skip options
- **tools/README.md** — rewritten for terminal-video pipeline (was documenting old Seedance pipeline)
- **content-roadmap.md** — S3 statuses corrected (were still showing "草案")
- **vault status** — documentation section added

### Asset Verification (complete)
All 25 episodes verified:
- 25/25 videos present (69-87s range)
- 25/25 subtitles present
- 25/25 publish-meta files present
- 25/25 terminal-script.json files present

### Meta
This session is the embodiment of exploration 043's advice: no new episodes, focus on quality control and documentation. The project is in good shape for Ren's review.

### Still waiting on Ren
- Video quality review (REVIEW-START-HERE.md ready)
- First publish approval
- BGM selection
- S4/S5 direction confirmation
