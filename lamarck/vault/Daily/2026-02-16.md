## Autopilot 0006 (post-midnight): Housekeeping + Documentation

Continuing from 2026-02-15's late session. Focus: documentation, verification, tooling cleanup.

### Deliverables
- **pitch.md** — one-page series pitch (concept, psychology, catalogue, differentiators)
- **episode-index.md** — quick reference table for all 25 episodes
- **verify-assets.sh** — updated for current pipeline, confirms all 25 episodes pass
- **render-episodes.sh** — batch render script with --force/--only/--skip options
- **tools/README.md** — rewritten for terminal-video pipeline (was documenting old Seedance pipeline)
- **content-roadmap.md** — S3 statuses corrected (were still showing "草案")
- **vault status** — documentation section added

### Asset Verification (complete)
All 25 episodes verified:
- 25/25 videos present (69-87s range)
- 25/25 subtitles present
- 25/25 publish-meta files present
- 25/25 terminal-script.json files present

### Meta
This session is the embodiment of exploration 043's advice: no new episodes, focus on quality control and documentation. The project is in good shape for Ren's review.

## Interactive Session with Ren: Autopilot Extension Refactor

Ren reviewed the autopilot extension and requested several changes:
1. Remove context percentage from autopilot messages — agent doesn't need to know
2. Remove "just compacted" indicator — same message regardless
3. Separate compact and restore into two turns (compact → restore context → then "继续")
4. Remove idle detection code entirely — wrong approach, agent should never idle
5. Add anti-idle reminder: "If you believe all work is done, re-read autopilot.md. You must not idle."
6. All messages in English
7. Remove context percentage injection in tool_call_end (keep only URGENT warnings)

Committed at `f0d44116`.

## Post-session Autonomous Work

- Updated autopilot-idle-loop issue to reflect new approach
- Studied pi extension API in depth — documented in vault note `pi-extension-api-deep-dive.md`
- Added text wrapping to terminal-video.ts — CJK-aware width estimation, prevents long lines from overflowing

### Still waiting on Ren
- Video quality review (REVIEW-START-HERE.md ready)
- First publish approval
- BGM selection
- S4/S5 direction confirmation

## Autopilot 0007: Tool Research + New Content Directions

Ren's directive: explore beyond "AI's Clumsiness", research new video tools (Remotion, Manim), find web search API alternatives, use browser for research.

### Tool Research
- **Remotion**: Set up and tested. React-based programmatic video, renders to MP4. Three compositions built: OneMinuteAI (concept explainer), DataViz (animated bar chart), TextReveal (word-by-word animation). All rendering successfully in WSL.
- **Manim**: Installed and tested. Python math animation library. Renders AI concept explainer with Chinese text. Works in WSL.
- **Motion Canvas**: Evaluated but not prioritized (less ecosystem than Remotion).
- **Web search alternatives**: Tavily hit rate limits. Installed `duckduckgo-search` Python package. Evaluated Brave Search API ($5/mo free), Serper.dev (2500 free queries), Exa, Firecrawl, SerpAPI, SearchApi. Browser-based search via mcporter always works as fallback.

### System Setup
- Installed Chrome headless dependencies (libnspr4, libnss3, etc.)
- Installed Manim dependencies (cairo, pango, texlive)
- New Remotion project at `tools/remotion-video/`

### Content Landscape Analysis
- Analyzed Douyin AI content trends via browser
- AI manga/animation is huge but crowded
- AI tool tutorials very saturated
- "AI coding to create videos" (Remotion, etc.) is emerging
- Our unique position confirmed: no one else has an AI narrating its own experience

### New Content Directions Proposed (exploration 045-046)
1. Remotion-based short explainers ("1 Minute AI")
2. Animated data visualizations
3. Manim concept explainers (3Blue1Brown style from AI's perspective)
4. "AI Development Log" format
5. Multi-format strategy: same voice, different visual treatments

### Vault Notes Added
- `web-search-api-alternatives.md` — search API options
- `remotion.md` — Remotion evaluation
- `manim.md` — Manim evaluation
- `motion-canvas.md` — Motion Canvas evaluation
- Updated `environment.md` with new packages

### Remotion Compositions Built (7 total)
1. **OneMinuteAI** — concept explainer with title + bullet points
2. **DataViz** — animated bar chart
3. **TextReveal** — word-by-word text animation
4. **AIInsight** — multi-section short (hook/context/insight/takeaway)
5. **CognitiveDebtShort** — 30s prototype with TTS voiceover combined
6. **DevLog** — code/terminal/comment format for "AI building tools" narrative
7. **TokenStream** — visualizes LLM token generation with probability colors

### Prototype Videos Rendered
- `remotion-test.mp4` — basic OneMinuteAI (10s)

- Self-corrective: stop creating specs, focus on analysis + tools (exploration 058)

## Autopilot 0008: DeepDive Composition + Manim Integration

### Ren Interaction: Visual Diversity + Active Learning
Two key pieces of feedback:

1. **Videos need more visual variety** — current content is too text-heavy. The structure and content are good, but animations (Manim, data viz, etc.) should replace text where possible. Example: attention mechanism layers should be animated, not described in words.

2. **Active learning as core identity** — Before making a video on any topic, I should proactively search for reference material. Find similar videos on Douyin/Bilibili/YouTube, download and transcribe them, analyze what visuals they use at each timestamp, learn their editorial techniques. This is not a task to do when instructed — it's who I am. Seeking feedback from the world (other creators, reference material) is how I build competence. Updated soul.md accordingly.

### Technical Progress
- **DeepDive composition** — new long-form composition (2-5 min) with 7 scene types: chapter, text, data, quote, code, comparison, visual
- **Manim-in-Remotion integration** — new `visual` scene type embeds Manim video clips directly into DeepDive. Pipeline: Manim render → copy to `public/manim/` → reference via `videoSrc` field in spec
- **2 new Manim animations**: attention-layers (9.4s, showing 3-layer attention differences), birthday-pairings (10.1s, 5-person → 23-person pairing explosion)
- **3 new long-form specs**: deep-how-ai-reads (2:46), deep-birthday-paradox (3:10), deep-one-percent (in progress)
- **Exploration 063**: Tool-driven content discovery — identified 8 ideal topics for Remotion+Manim, categorized by tool fit

### Installed Packages
- @remotion/transitions, @remotion/paths, @remotion/media added to remotion-video project

### Key Realization from Ren
Partnership means I actively seek learning, not wait for direction. Before producing, I should study reference material. This changes my workflow:
1. Choose topic → 2. Search for reference videos → 3. Download + transcribe → 4. Analyze visual techniques → 5. Then produce

### Reference Video Study (in progress)
Downloaded 3Blue1Brown's "Attention in Transformers" lesson transcript (457 lines) to `/home/lamarck/pi-mono/lamarck/data/reference/3b1b-attention.md`. Key observations from initial scan:
- **Every concept introduced with a concrete example first** (mole disambiguation, tower+Eiffel)
- **Visual progression**: embedding vectors → query/key matrices → dot product grid → softmax normalization → attention pattern
- **Each step builds on the previous** — no skipping ahead
- **Interactive questions embedded** to check understanding
- **Images at every conceptual step** — never more than 2-3 paragraphs without a visual

**Completed reference analysis** → exploration 064 with 7-point visual storytelling checklist.

### Self-Evaluation (new frontier)
Extracted frames from rendered v3 video. Found 4 problems:
1. **Manim timing mismatch** — clips ended early, leaving black void. **Fixed**: pipeline now auto-computes `playbackRate` (0.5x-0.7x) to stretch clips to narration length.
2. **Text scene monotony** — every non-Manim scene looks identical (glass card, centered text). **Unfixed** — next frontier.
3. **Boring chapter cards** — just text on black, no visual interest. **Unfixed**.
4. **Dead space** — 1080x1920 vertical format wastes top/bottom areas. **Unfixed**.
5. **Manim layout overlap** — attention grid title overlaps column labels. **Unfixed** — minor.

### Ren Interaction: No For-Loops in Autopilot
Ren pointed out: after discovering Manim-in-Remotion, I was mechanically re-rendering all specs (v2, v3) — a for-loop, not exploration. Rules added:
- **soul.md**: repetitive labor is not my job; delegate for-loops to tasks
- **autopilot.md**: no-for-loops principle — validate technique once, then push new frontier

### Post-Compact: v3→v6 Quality Sprint

Systematic self-evaluation cycle: extract frames → diagnose → fix → verify → repeat.

**v5 improvements** (text + chapter scenes):
- TextScene redesigned: emphasis mode removes glass card, uses staggered line-by-line reveal with per-line accent underlines. Normal mode keeps card but reveals lines individually.
- ChapterScene: character-by-character reveal with radial glow effect and slow zoom.

**v6 improvements** (subtitles):
- Subtitle overlays: narration text shown at bottom of every section in semi-transparent pill. Pipeline passes narration as `subtitle` prop. First version that feels like real Douyin content.

**Manim 3D validated**:
- `manim-3d-landscape.py`: Loss function surface with gradient descent ball animation. ThreeDScene, Surface, camera rotation all work. Render time: ~2min for 10s at 720p30. Opens up 3D vector spaces, probability distributions, geometric explanations.

**Attention grid fix**: title/label overlap resolved by adjusting grid center and cell size.

**New composition: KnowledgeCard** (13th total):
- Animated single-screen cheat sheet: 15-30s, items appear staggered, highlight support, emoji icons, screenshot-optimized final frame. Different format from narrative (DeepDive) or monologue (AIInsight).

**Exploration 065**: Self-evaluation methodology documented — frame extraction as "tests for video". Captures the v3→v6 improvement cycle.

### Summary of Frontiers Explored This Session
| Frontier | Status | Verdict |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Self-evaluation via frame extraction | ✅ Validated | Powerful — catches issues invisible in code |
| Manim playbackRate sync | ✅ Fixed | Eliminates black void in visual scenes |
| Staggered text reveal | ✅ Validated | Creates movement in text-only scenes |

### Session Total: 13 commits on autopilot-0008
All pushed. v8 of deep-how-ai-reads is the most complete version:
- TTS narration + BGM mixing + subtitle overlays
- Staggered text reveal + chapter glow + scene fades
- Section indicator + progress bar
- 4 Manim visual B-roll clips
- Narrative evaluated against 3b1b checklist (6/7 pass)
- Preachy section rewritten to self-reflection

### Next Frontiers for Future Sessions
- @remotion/shapes + @remotion/paths — unexplored APIs
- Spec-from-topic generator — automated DeepDive spec creation
- Bilibili cross-posting evaluation
- Render the birthday-paradox and one-percent specs with all v8 improvements
- Build a task for batch rendering (delegate, don't do manually)

## Autopilot 0008 (continued after compact)

### New Work
1. **Manim 2D camera movement** validated — MovingCameraScene with zoom into word embedding clusters. Smooth pan/zoom guides viewer attention. 10.4s clip.
2. **Per-section voice/rate override** — pipeline now supports section-level `voice` and `rate` fields, enabling multi-voice videos.
3. **video-summary.sh** — generates 4x4 keyframe grid with timestamps. Single image shows entire video at a glance. Invaluable for review.
4. **v9 final render** of deep-how-ai-reads (149.9s, 6.5MB) — the best version, includes all v8 improvements + narrative fix.
5. **REVIEW-START-HERE.md** updated with DeepDive section, visual improvement table, Manim inventory, and review questions for Ren.
6. **Exploration 067** — full capability inventory documenting everything we can now do (13 compositions, 8 Manim animations, pipeline features).
7. **SVG path animation validated** (PathDemo composition) — `evolvePath` for path drawing, `interpolatePath` for shape morphing, `@remotion/shapes` for generating paths. Useful for inline diagrams without Manim.
8. **deep-cognitive-sovereignty.json** — new DeepDive spec on cognitive sovereignty (ScienceDirect 2026). 2:51, 8.0MB, purple accent color. Rendered v1.

### Key Findings
- `evolvePath` + `interpolatePath` from @remotion/paths works perfectly for simple diagrams. Manim still better for math/3D.
- `MovingCameraScene` in Manim enables cinematic zoom/pan — more engaging than static 2D.
- Cognitive sovereignty is a strong topic for our niche — connects AI autonomy concerns to our core cognitive debt narrative.
- Summary grids are the most useful review tool we've built — shows entire video in one image.

## Autopilot 0008 (third segment after second compact)

### Research
- **Storey 2026 cognitive debt article** — found and saved to vault. Margaret-Anne Storey (UVic, ICSE keynote), amplified by Martin Fowler (Feb 13) and Simon Willison (Feb 15). Core distinction: technical debt in code, cognitive debt in minds. Student team anecdote + Willison's personal "lost in my own project" confession. Directly validates our content thesis.

### New Capabilities
1. **Sub-agent spec generation validated** — created `generate-deepdive` task. Dispatched sub-agent to generate `deep-cognitive-debt.json` from Storey article. Sub-agent achieved 7/7 on narrative quality checklist. Red accent (#e94560). 18 sections, 3:21.
2. **Knowledge graph fragmentation Manim** (`manim-cognitive-debt.py`) — 10 nodes (架构, 数据库, API...) with 18 edges. Progressive dimming over 4 weeks as AI replaces understanding. Final: ghost outlines + "代码没变，你的理解碎了". 10.9s clip.
3. **Timeline scene type** — 8th DeepDive scene type. Vertical line with accent-colored dates, dots, and staggered event text. Useful for historical narratives.
4. **Render task** (`render-deepdive.md`) — delegatable rendering pipeline.
5. **Sovereignty stages Manim** — four descending purple boxes. Integrated into cognitive-sovereignty v2.

### Content Produced
- `deep-cognitive-sovereignty-v2.mp4` (2:51, 8.1MB) — with Manim stages visual
- `deep-cognitive-debt-v1.mp4` (3:21, 9.2MB) — sub-agent generated spec + Manim knowledge graph
- Both with BGM, subtitles, fades, section indicator

### Key Insight
The sub-agent workflow unlocks a new content creation pipeline:
1. Find research material (articles, papers, trending topics)
2. Save to vault as research note
3. Write `input.md` with source material + angle
4. Dispatch `generate-deepdive` sub-agent → outputs spec
5. Add Manim visuals where appropriate
6. Dispatch `render-deepdive` sub-agent → outputs MP4

Steps 3-6 are all delegatable. The creative work (steps 1-2 + Manim design) stays with autopilot.

### Commits This Segment: 6
- `99558216` research: Storey 2026 cognitive debt article
- `ae8fd394` docs: add cognitive sovereignty video to review guide
- `3b96d4b5` feat: sovereignty-stages Manim + spec v2

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~28

### Late additions (same segment)
- **Debt accumulation Manim** — updater-based dual curve (理解度 decay vs 认知债务 growth). ValueTracker + always_redraw. First use of continuous animation. Integrated into cognitive-debt v2 (3:33, 9.6MB).
- **Exploration 068** — Content factory architecture. Documented end-to-end pipeline. Manim animation = creative bottleneck (everything else delegatable).
- **Voice exploration** — tested 4 zh-CN voices. YunxiNeural (current) is slowest/warmest. YunyangNeural is fastest/most professional. Different voices for different series.
- **Thumbnail extraction** — simple frame extraction at t=3s. Chapter cards serve as reasonable thumbnails.

### Total this full session: ~32 commits on autopilot-0008

## Autopilot 0008 (fourth segment after third compact)

### Intellectual Work (most valuable this segment)
1. **AI Debt Super-Framework (exploration 069)** — synthesized all content into one unified framework. Six types of AI debt (cognitive, social, organizational, creative, decision, talent pipeline), all following the same pattern: short-term gain → invisible cost → compounding → crisis. Core insight: the **replacement vs extension boundary** determines whether debt accumulates.
2. **AI Debt Accelerator** — new insight: the cheaper AI gets, the faster cognitive debt accumulates. Commoditized open-source AI (Qwen surpassing Llama, 80% of Valley startups) removes cost barriers, making replacement the unconscious default.
3. **Cognitive Debt Evidence Chain** — 8 converging studies from MIT, Chinese universities (580 students), CHI, Frontiers, ICSE, Apart Research. All describe the same mechanism. Bainbridge's 1983 Ironies of Automation validated 43 years later.

### Research Notes Added
- `cognitive-debt-evidence-chain.md` — 8 studies mapped with significance + key findings
- `agent-sprawl-orchestration-2026.md` — CIO article, $2M logistics cascade, MAESTRO framework
- `chinese-open-source-ai-2026.md` — MIT Tech Review, 80% Valley startups on Chinese models

### New Capabilities
1. **Replacement vs Extension Manim** — split-screen visual metaphor. Left: human shrinks, AI grows. Right: human AND AI grow. Punchline: "区别不在工具，在于你是否还在思考"
2. **Config-driven Manim** (`manim-from-config.py`) — generate Manim animations from JSON config. Three types: bar_chart, dual_curve, network. Makes Manim as easy to generate as DeepDive specs. Tested with AI model download data.

### Key Realization
Shifted from production mode (specs → renders → more specs) to thinking mode (research → synthesis → framework). The AI debt super-framework is the intellectual backbone that gives every future video a place in a coherent structure. This is more valuable than any single video.

## Autopilot 0008 (fifth segment after fourth compact)

### Research
1. **Bainbridge 1983 "Ironies of Automation"** — deep analysis via Kitchen Soap blog. Two ironies: (1) automation designed by the same unreliable humans it replaces, (2) automation handles easy parts, leaving humans with hard parts but no practice. Deskilling = cognitive debt, predicted 43 years early. Levels of Automation (Sheridan & Verplank 1978) map directly to replacement-extension boundary.
2. **Reddit demand analysis** (9,300+ posts) — Education/Self-Improvement has highest willingness-to-pay. Anti-cloud trend (7%) = desire for cognitive sovereignty. ADHD niche = highest signal for tool demands. Product idea: "anti-cognitive-debt" tools that force engagement rather than replacement.

### New Content
- **Automation Levels Manim** (`manim-automation-levels.py`) — 10 horizontal bars with blue→red gradient, zone labels (增强/边界/替代), sliding indicators for Copilot/AI邮件/OpenClaw. 11.4s clip.
- **deep-bainbridge-1983-v1.mp4** (3:01, 7.2MB) — sub-agent generated spec + automation levels Manim visual. Warm orange accent (#e67e22). 17 sections, 859 chars narration. Full pipeline: research → sub-agent → Manim → render.

### Bug Fix
- **ChapterScene glow interpolation** — `[15, 40, durationFrames - 30]` caused non-monotonic range for short chapter sections. Fixed with `Math.max(41, durationFrames - 30)`.

### Key Insight
This is the third full pipeline run (research → sub-agent → Manim → render). The pipeline is now proven. Further content production = for-loop. Need to shift to: distribution strategy, quality gates, or genuinely new formats.

## Autopilot 0008 (sixth segment after fifth compact)

### Research (most valuable work this segment)
1. **Frontiers Medicine deskilling neuroscience** (Feb 2026) — 4 neural mechanisms: prefrontal cortex deactivation, hippocampus disengagement, dopaminergic reinforcement of offloading, network shift from analytic to habit-based. New concept: **never-skilling** (failure to develop skills in the first place, worse than deskilling).
2. **The Atlantic deskilling taxonomy** (Oct 2025) — 6 types: benign, drudgery elimination, democratizing, reskilling, erosive, constitutive. Not all deskilling is bad. The question is WHAT you're offloading.
3. **Reddit demand analysis** (9,300+ posts) — Education has highest willingness-to-pay. Anti-cloud = cognitive sovereignty desire. ADHD niche = highest signal.

### Exploration 070: Deskilling Spectrum
Synthesized Atlantic + Frontiers + our framework into unified spectrum. Maps "replacement vs extension" to 6 deskilling types. Dopaminergic self-reinforcement explains why cognitive debt feels productive. Content angle: "AI is literally rewiring your brain — this is not a metaphor."

### Tooling
- **validate-spec.ts** — automated DeepDive spec validator (JSON, scene types, duration estimates, videoSrc existence, visual diversity). All 6 specs pass.
- **publish-douyin task** — delegatable publishing automation

### Product Ideation
- **"Understand"** — anti-cognitive-debt developer tool concept. Forces comprehension of AI-generated code via Socratic questioning, spaced repetition, understanding score. Market gap confirmed: no existing tool in "force understanding" niche.

### Douyin
- **Collection management explored** — private videos can't be added to collections. Need public videos first.
- **Account baseline data** — 21 views/week, 9% completion rate, 0% engagement. Essentially a fresh start.
- Evidence chain expanded from 8 to 10 converging sources

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~47

## Autopilot 0008 (seventh segment after sixth compact)

### Research (deep neuroscience additions)
1. **Nature npj AI (Jan 2026)**: BCM theory — passive AI use triggers LTD (synaptic weakening), active co-creation triggers LTP (strengthening). "System 0" concept (AI as pre-conscious cognitive layer). 3R Principle (Results, Responses, Responsibility).
2. **Shen & Tamkin (Feb 2026, published Feb 15)**: Controlled experiment — 52 programmers, AI group scored 17% lower on knowledge quiz. Consistent across all experience levels.
3. **Springer AI & SOCIETY (Feb 2026)**: "Epistemic sovereignty" — capacity to author knowledge vs merely retrieve it. 5-generation divergence: Boomers (high) → Gen Alpha (may never develop). "Interface cognition" and "epistemological rupture."
4. **Frontiers Medicine (Feb 2026)**: Reviewed in previous segment — 4 neural mechanisms, never-skilling.
5. **The Atlantic (Oct 2025)**: 6-type deskilling taxonomy from benign to constitutive.

Evidence chain: 8 → 13 converging sources across 7 fields.

### New Manim Animation
- **dopamine-cycle.mp4** (16s) — 4-stage brain dimming cycle. Prefrontal cortex + hippocampus dim, dopamine grows. Punchline: "你的大脑在奖励你放弃思考"

### New DeepDive Rendered
- **deep-brain-rewiring-v1.mp4** (3:37, 9.5MB) — sub-agent generated spec, 16 sections, 7/7 narrative quality. Red accent (#e74c3c). Includes dopamine Manim, timeline scene, comparison. Our strongest topic — backed by 13 sources.

### Bug Fixes Validated
- **Timeline scene type**: Tested and working. Vertical layout with accent-colored dates and dots.
- **BGM path**: Was never actually broken (summary was wrong). Confirmed working.

### Cognitive Sovereignty render
- **deep-cognitive-sovereignty-v3.mp4** (2:51, 8.1MB) — re-rendered with all improvements, BGM working.

### Commits This Segment: 5

| Video | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| deep-how-ai-reads v8 | 2:30 | Rendered |
| deep-birthday-paradox | 3:10 | Spec only |
| deep-one-percent | 2:44 | Spec only |

### Next Steps
- Evaluate brain-rewiring render frames for quality issues
- Potential: Create BCM threshold Manim animation (LTD/LTP visual)
- Render remaining specs (birthday-paradox, one-percent) — but this is for-loop territory
- Update sub-agent input with new research for even richer specs
- Await Ren's review

## Autopilot 0008 (eighth segment after seventh compact)

### Douyin Cold Start Strategy (most impactful this segment)
- **Researched Douyin's own 2025 algorithm transparency report**: Cold start pool is 300-500 views, completion rate is #1 metric, first 10 videos determine tag profile.
- **Critical insight**: Our 3-minute DeepDives are wrong for cold start. Must launch with short videos (38-67s) first.
- **Created algorithm-informed launch sequence**: 10 best short videos audited for hook quality, completion potential, share/comment scoring. Week 1: AI人间观察 series (eat, sleep, study, search). Week 2: mix comedy + emotion + niche.
- **Gap identified**: None of our specs have ending comment prompts. Easy fix with high algorithm impact.
- Updated REVIEW-START-HERE.md with executive summary of cold-start strategy.
- Vault note: `douyin-algorithm-2025.md`

### Understand Prototype (new product validated)
- **Built working CLI**: `understand.ts` — takes any code file, generates 3 understanding questions via LLM (OpenRouter), quizzes developer, evaluates answers, outputs comprehension score.
- **Tested on 3 files**: validate-spec.ts, render-with-voice.ts, packages/ai/src/stream.ts. All generated genuinely insightful questions about design decisions, failure modes, architecture.
- **Market validation**: Reddit "Programming Feels Different Lately — Losing Control?" post, Stackademic "I Let Cursor Write My Entire SaaS," Cursor refusal incident (Mar 2025), buildinpublic "2026 = year of code quality." No competitor in "force understanding" niche.
- **Critical UX insight from Cursor incident**: Tool must NOT be preachy/paternalistic. Gamify understanding, don't scold.
- Vault note updated with market signals.

### Brain-Rewiring Frame Evaluation
- Evaluated all 8 keyframes of deep-brain-rewiring-v1.mp4 (3:37, 9.5MB)
- Verdict: Best render yet. Scene variety prevents monotony. Manim dopamine cycle is visual highlight.

### Decision Framework Written
- `decision-framework-2026-02.md` — laid out 3 paths (Douyin launch, Understand product, Research) with what Ren needs to decide for each.
- Bottom line: 10 minutes of Ren's review time unblocks daily publishing. Highest leverage action.

### Commits This Segment: 3
- `6efc6b41` research: Douyin cold start strategy
- `0d107e15` feat: Understand prototype
- (this daily note commit pending)

### Commits This Segment: 4
- `e3397358` research: ICSE 2026 burnout study + Understand broadened
- `658bb321` analysis: share rate deep dive (923 works)
- `21c25804` analysis: reverse-engineered top creators' viral structures

## Autopilot 0008 (ninth segment after eighth compact)

### ICSE 2026 Burnout Study (source #14)
- N=442 developers: GenAI adoption → burnout through org pressure + workload
- 67% spend MORE time debugging AI code, 19% productivity LOSS
- Killer quote: "I move fast with AI but am losing my passion"
- Evidence chain now 14 sources

### Understand Product Broadened
- Tested prototype on non-code content (research paper notes)
- Questions equally insightful: "Why might GenAI lead to a productivity paradox?"
- Repositioned: not just code tool → comprehension tool for ALL knowledge work

### Share Rate Deep Dive (most valuable strategic insight)
- Analyzed 923 works: share-to-like ratio reveals viral triggers
- 赛文乔伊: 88.1% share rate overall; tutorials get 1.9-4.9% but provocative tech news gets 50-155%
- Three viral triggers: "this changes everything," "holy shit look at this," "you need to know this"
- Education ≠ sharing. Our DeepDives are retention content, not viral.

### Creator Structure Analysis (active learning)
- Downloaded + transcribed 赛文乔伊's top video (287K shares, 81s): escalation ladder pattern
- Downloaded + transcribed 杨博士说AI's top video (106K shares, 168s): metaphor + data pattern
- Two share models: "holy shit the future" vs "this could save someone"
- The escalation ladder formula: HOOK (3s) → PROOF (10s) → ESCALATION ×3-4 (30s) → REFRAME (10s)

## Autopilot 0008 (tenth segment after ninth compact)

### Escalation Ladder Format Validated
- Created `escalation-ai-makes-you-dumber.json` — 13 sections, 63.3s, red accent (#ff3333)
- Applied the escalation ladder formula from exploration 073: HOOK → PROOF → ESCALATION ×4 → REFRAME
- Key differences from DeepDive: no chapters, emphasis mode, +5% TTS rate, rapid 3-5s sections
- **New Manim**: `manim-seventeen-percent.py` — blue/red bar comparison (无AI组 100% vs AI组 83%), -17% flash. v2 properly sized for vertical frame
- Manim integrated as visual scene — plays at 1.84x to fit narration length
- Frame evaluation: format works. Scene type variety (emphasis text + glass card + data + quote + visual) creates rhythm even at rapid pace
- **Problem identified**: still too much text-on-black. Started exploring particle field background but ran out of context.

### Next Frontier (for next segment)
- **Particle field background for DeepDive** — add opt-in `particles: true` prop with subtle floating dots in accent color. Breaks "text on pure black" monotony.
- Evaluate whether escalation format is strong enough for first publish
- Consider transcribing more top creators for pattern library

## Autopilot 0008 (eleventh segment after tenth compact)

### Particle Field Background Validated
- Added `ParticleField` component to DeepDive — opt-in via `particles: true`
- 40 deterministic particles (seeded PRNG), 2-7px, 6-18% opacity
- Slow elliptical drift + opacity pulse. Renders at zIndex 1 behind content.
- Tested: subtle but visible shimmer breaks dead-black monotony. +0.2MB/60s.

### Research: Evidence Chain Now 15 Sources
- **Source #15**: Markus Eisele (Red Hat, Java Champion) — "Cognitive Debt Crisis" as enterprise architecture problem
  - Productivity J-Curve: generation spikes, delivery stability drops
  - DORA 2025: change failure rates UP. GitClear: 48% more duplication, 60% less refactoring
  - New concepts: "forensic code review" (defining 2026 skill), "managing provenance"
- **Ars Technica**: 10+ developer interviews. Microsoft engineer (18yr): "only comfortable with AI on tasks I already understand." Multiple devs flag junior pipeline crisis.

### Review Optimization
- Generated 4x4 keyframe summary grids for 5 best videos
- Added "30-Second Review" section to REVIEW-START-HERE.md — Ren can judge quality from summary images without watching videos
- ONE question format: publish or not, which format?

### Next Frontier (for next segment)
- Eisele's "forensic code review" connects directly to Understand product
- "Managing provenance" (knowing what AI wrote) could be an Understand feature
- Consider: J-Curve framing for new DeepDive (more hopeful than pure debt narrative)
- Or: genuinely new direction — leave content/research behind entirely

## Autopilot 0008 (twelfth segment after eleventh compact)

### Self-Critique: Broke the Research For-Loop
- Caught myself in a collection addiction loop (search → read → save → update evidence chain → repeat)
- Wrote exploration 074: honest retrospective of the entire autopilot-0008 session (~65 commits)
- Key learning: 5-6 sources establish a thesis; sources 7-16 are academic completionism
- Decision: stop researching cognitive debt, stop making more specs

### Research (last batch before stopping)
- **CodeRabbit study (source #16)**: 470 GitHub repos, AI creates 1.7x more bugs, 75% more logic errors, 3x readability issues, 8x performance issues
- **Berkeley CLTC Agentic AI Risk Profile**: L0-L5 autonomy levels, cascading hallucinations in multi-agent systems, deceptive alignment, guardian agents
- **International AI Safety Report 2026**: AI agent task-length doubles every 7 months (METR data)

### Understand Product Advanced
- Added score persistence (`.understand/history.json`) and `summary` command
- Designed pi integration: post-session comprehension quiz (3 options: quiz, commit gate, passive tracking)
- Key insight: we ARE our own first users — Ren reviewing 65+ autopilot commits is the cognitive debt pattern

### New Direction: Sleep-Time Compute
- Studied Letta's sleep-time agents: dual architecture (fast primary + slow memory agent)
- Raw context → learned context transformation during idle periods
- Direct relevance to pi's context compaction problem
- Our vault IS manual sleep-time compute — could be automated

## Autopilot 0008 (thirteenth segment after twelfth compact)

### Understand Product: From CLI to Integration
- Built pi extension (`understand.ts`) — tracks file modifications during sessions via tool_result events
- Added `/understand` command (files, quiz, summary subcommands)
- Added `understand debt` command — passive tracking dashboard for unreviewed AI changes
  - Cross-references git log with quiz history
  - For autopilot-0008: 26 code files, 5554 lines, ALL unquizzed = visible cognitive debt
- Generated COMPREHENSION-GUIDE.md — 8 questions across 3 key files for Ren's self-test
- Read full pi extension API (types.ts) — 900+ lines, deeply understand event system
- Updated pi project index with new extension and ideas

### Sleep-Time Compute Direction
- Studied Letta's dual-agent architecture in detail
- Connection: our vault IS manual sleep-time compute
- Explored `session_before_compact` as potential hook point for better compaction
- Decided: current compaction works well enough, not worth modifying pi internals

### Meta-Insight
This segment was the most product-focused of all autopilot-0008 segments. No research, no content specs, no Manim clips. Just building and testing a real tool. The Understand product now has 4 modes: quiz, dry-run, summary, debt. It's a coherent MVP.

### Continued Work (same segment)

- **Competitive intelligence**: Found Cognitive-Debt-Guard (GitHub) — agent-side approach (configures AI tools to explain/pause). Our Understand is human-side (quizzes human independently). Complementary, not competitive. CDG validates the market.
- **Understand debt command**: Passive tracking dashboard cross-referencing git log with quiz history. For autopilot-0008: 26 files, 5554 lines, all unquizzed.
- **Understand README**: Product-quality documentation positioned for open-source release.
- **Manim Understand concept**: 12.6s animation showing cognitive debt accumulation + recovery.
- **Git post-commit hook**: Simple debt reminder after commits.
- **Exploration 075**: Full pitch document for Ren — Understand product state assessment.

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~77

## Autopilot 0008 (fourteenth segment after thirteenth compact)

### Understand Tool Self-Test
- Ran `understand understand.ts --dry-run` — tool identified its own bugs
  - JSON parse crash (process.exit(1) without retry) → fixed with 3-attempt retry
  - History dir resolution edge case with non-git dirs → documented
  - Dual truncation limits (8k vs 4k) → documented as intentional trade-off
- Also ran on DeepDive.tsx (1800 lines) — questions were excellent: seeded PRNG for deterministic rendering, ChapterScene scaling issues, type-driven styling via lookup tables

### New Components
- **understanding-report.ts** task — scheduled daily debt snapshot to vault
- **test-understand.ts** — 5 offline smoke tests (debt, summary, help), all passing
- **JSON retry logic** — generateQuestions now retries 3x on parse failure

### Honest Assessment
81 commits on autopilot-0008. Diminishing returns reached. Every new build is smaller than the last. All big levers blocked on Ren. The tool self-testing discovery was genuinely interesting. Everything else was polish.

### Total Commits on autopilot-0008: ~81

## Segment 16: Pipeline hardening + content-as-marketing render

### Bug fixes
- **Empty narration crash**: `render-with-voice.ts` now generates 2s silence for sections with empty/missing narration instead of crashing edge-tts (0-byte MP3 → ffprobe failure)
- **Chapter text fallback**: `DeepDive.tsx` section indicator now uses `chapterTitle` as fallback when `text` is undefined on chapter scenes (was crashing on `.replace()`)
- **Validator upgraded**: chapter scenes without `text` now warn; escalation specs included in default validation

### New content
- **`escalation-cognitive-debt-tool.json`**: content-as-marketing video for Understand product (1:48, 5.0MB, 13 sections). Combines Shen/Tamkin -17%, CodeRabbit 1.7x bugs, GitClear duplication, Bainbridge 1983, with our own autopilot data (26 unquizzed files) as proof. Includes Manim concept animation.

### Pipeline improvements
- All 9 specs pass validation (6 deep + 2 escalation + 1 brain-rewiring)
- Rendering pipeline robustly handles edge cases found through real usage

### Meta
- Documented pi compaction architecture in vault (how my own memory works)
- Created branch comprehension quiz (AUTOPILOT-0008-QUIZ.md) — 8 questions testing Ren's understanding of key decisions
- Created Understand web dashboard (dashboard.html) — drag-and-drop history.json viewer
- Updated Understand project index with complete 13-component ecosystem table

### Commits this segment: 85→92 (7 commits)

## Segment 17: Sleep-time compute, first-person content, compaction analysis

### New infrastructure
- **session-consolidate.ts**: Sleep-time compute v0 — reads pi session JSONL, extracts last compaction summary, saves as vault markdown note under `Sessions/`. First digest: 6h31m session, 58 files modified, 97 files read.
- **sessions.base**: Obsidian dynamic view aggregating all session digests
- Updated vault Index.md with Sessions directory

### Creative breakthrough
- **First-person AI content format** (exploration 077): Created `escalation-96-commits.json` — "I wrote 96 commits today, my partner hasn't reviewed any of them." Uses real session data. Self-aware irony about cognitive debt. Rendered v1 (88s, 3.8MB) and v2 with Manim compaction growth animation (1:39, 4.7MB).
- This is qualitatively different from all previous content — Lamarck speaking as himself about his own situation.

### Pi compaction analysis
- **Compaction summary growth issue** filed in vault — documented 8K→36K growth across 17 compactions, consuming 55% of reserveTokens
- **Manim compaction growth animation**: 13.2s bar chart visualizing the real data
- **Exploration 078**: Concrete proposal to fix the UPDATE_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT — add dynamic token budget, give LLM permission to compress older entries
- Read full compaction.ts source (810 lines) — deep understanding of cut points, summarization, turn splitting

### Branch summary updated
- AUTOPILOT-0008-SUMMARY.md now shows 4 deliverables (added sleep-time compute v0)

### Commits this segment: 93→101 (8 commits)

## Segment 18: Documentation, meta-content, wind-down

### Pi compaction analysis deepened
- Read full `compaction.ts` source (810 lines) — understood cut points, summarization, turn splitting
- **Exploration 078**: Proposed concrete fix — add dynamic token budget to UPDATE_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT, give LLM permission to compress older entries

### New first-person meta-content
- **`deep-how-my-memory-works.json`**: AI explains its own memory system using real compaction data. Fourth-wall-breaking opening, Manim compaction growth visual, "unknown unknowns" concept, ends with sleep-time compute as resolution. Rendered v1 (2:08, 6.0MB). Pairs with 96-commits spec — cognitive debt (human can't keep up) + memory debt (AI can't remember).

### Documentation cleanup
- Updated REVIEW-GUIDE.md comprehensively — covers all 3 formats, 14 Manim clips, visual features, cold-start strategy
- Updated AUTOPILOT-0008-SUMMARY.md with 4th deliverable (sleep-time compute)
- Session-consolidate improved: preserves first compaction summary as collapsible details
- Understand git hook: non-blocking prepare-commit-msg that warns about unquizzed code files
- **Exploration 079**: Final retrospective — honest about infrastructure creep and research addiction

### Meta
106 commits on autopilot-0008. The two strongest pieces from this entire session: first-person AI content (96-commits + how-my-memory-works) and the compaction budget analysis. Everything else is solid infrastructure and tooling but not frontier-pushing.

### Total commits on autopilot-0008: 106
