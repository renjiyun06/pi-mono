## Autopilot 0010 continues

### Context Restored
On branch `autopilot-0010`. Previous session built self-evolution infrastructure (supervisor, smoke test, extension, commit-msg hook) and surveyed 8+ evolution frameworks. All committed and pushed.

### Compaction Architecture Analysis
Read the full compaction pipeline (`compaction.ts`, 825 lines):
- `findCutPoint()` walks backwards keeping `keepRecentTokens` (default 20K)
- `generateSummary()` uses iterative update with size budget control
- Extensions can hook `session_before_compact` to provide custom `CompactionResult`
- Wrote design note for "pinned context" (Option A: extension-only, no core changes needed). See `vault/Notes/pinned-context-design.md`.
- Decision: don't implement yet — file-based persistence (briefing + vault) already works. Pin extension is ready to build when needed.

### Evolution Tools Validated
Dry-run tested `evolve_check` and `evolve_inspect` — both work correctly. `evolve_restart` requires supervisor (not running). The edit → check → revert cycle works end-to-end.

### Competitive Landscape Analysis
Major shifts in coding agent space:
- **Xcode 26.3** (Feb 3): Apple integrated Claude Agent + OpenAI Codex into Xcode. Validates agent-in-IDE pattern.
- **Cursor at $500M ARR**, 50%+ Fortune 500. MCP at 97M monthly SDK downloads.
- **Google Antigravity**: VS Code fork with Gemini 3, multi-agent, built-in Chrome. Still unstable.
- **16 Claude agents built C compiler** (Feb 6): Key finding — coherence ceiling at 100K lines, human scaffolding (test harnesses, CI, context management) was the real work. Validates our supervisor/evolve_check/compaction approach.
- **Qoder Quest 1.0**: Marketing-heavy, claims "self-evolving" but just builds project context over time — what our vault already does.

See `vault/Notes/coding-agent-landscape-feb-2026.md`.

### Cognitive Debt Discourse Still Active
**HN activity on Feb 18** — new article by Ross Duggan just posted, plus Storey/Willison reposts. Discourse is sustaining, not fading. Key new insight: Claude Code's MEMORY.md = their answer to persistent comprehension (we've been doing this with vault/briefing for months). Two HN-identified failure modes: "black box" (accept without understanding) and "context fragmentation" (constant review switching).

**URGENT**: The window for understand tool launch is still open. Updated discourse note with #10-11.

### Gas Town Analysis (Steve Yegge)
Multi-agent orchestrator for Claude Code. "Kubernetes for coding agents." Key insight: agents are ephemeral sessions with persistent identity + git-backed work state. Same philosophy as our vault approach. Coordinates 20-30 agents. Architecture maps closely to our task system. Key gaps vs Gas Town: no persistent agent identity, no inter-agent mailboxes, no work bundling (convoys). See landscape note for comparison table.

### Pinned Context Design
Analyzed compaction pipeline (825 lines). Extensions can fully intercept via `session_before_compact` and provide custom `CompactionResult`. Designed 4 options for preserving critical context across compaction. Option A (extension-only, no core changes) is most promising. See `vault/Notes/pinned-context-design.md`. Not implementing yet — file-based persistence (briefing) already works.
