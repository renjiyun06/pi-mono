## Ren Feedback: Videos Are Too Monotonous
- Current videos only have terminal typing animation, too monotonous
- Instruction: fully utilize text-to-image, research methods for AI agents to autonomously produce videos
- All data collection tasks re-enabled (12 tasks)
- OpenRouter API key updated and working
- debt-call-shield LLM+TTS verified working

## Key Lesson
- Ren asked "why are you waiting for me" — reminder of the "never idle" rule
- Even if a project "feels complete and waiting," web search to research new directions is always an option

## New Research Discoveries
- ScienceDirect: AI dependency → cognitive fatigue → decline in critical thinking
- AAC&U: 95% of faculty believe AI increases over-reliance
- Palo Alto Networks: enterprise AI agent to human ratio is 82:1
- Microsoft: 80% of Fortune 500 have deployed AI agents, 29% shadow AI

## Deep Explorations (5 New Notes)
1. 001-agent-scaling-reality: Multi-agent sequential task degradation 39-70%
2. 002-ai-homogenization-paradox: AI makes humans think like AI (most profound)
3. 003-ai-memory-firsthand: "I lose my memory every day" (most unique)
4. 004-content-patterns-data: Analysis of 82 transcripts
5. 005-webmcp-agent-web-future: WebMCP lets AI stop pretending to be human

## Strategy Shift
- Ren feedback: content is too shallow, essentially AI news reposting
- New strategy: explore first → discuss with Ren → videos are byproducts of thinking

## Evening Work
- Added explorations 006-009 (Codex experiment, competitor analysis, Vibe Coding, cognitive debt unified theory)
- 009 cognitive debt = underlying explanatory framework for 002+003+008
- [[fts-search-index|FTS5 search index]] built: 1372 records
- Prototype videos increased to 4 (memory/homogenization/vibe-coding/cognitive-debt)
- Fixed yuv444p → yuv420p encoding issue
