# 2026-02-17

## Autopilot 0008 continues (segment 50-51, post-midnight from Feb 16)

### Research
- **Evidence #23**: HBR 8-month study (Ranganathan & Ye, Feb 2026) — AI adoption → workload creep → cognitive fatigue → more AI dependence. Martin Fowler (Feb 13) also responded to Storey's cognitive debt post with cruft/debt distinction. Camille Fournier: "everyone becomes a manager" fatigue.
- **Key Fowler insight**: Mid-level devs most at risk (not juniors). "DevEx and Agent Experience is a circle."
- **China influencer credential law (Oct 2025)**: Requires credentials for education/medicine/finance/law influencers. Tech commentary appears safe (competitors still active), but "incites pessimism" clause is a risk for our "AI makes you dumber" framing.
- **Qwen3-TTS** (Jan 2026): Open-source TTS from Alibaba. Voice cloning + emotion control. Blocked on GPU but API available at $0.115/10K chars. Document for future.
- **VibeVoice** (Microsoft): 1.5B, 90min output, multi-speaker, English+Chinese. Another GPU-blocked option.

### Creative Work
- **Manim workload spiral**: New 13.7s animation visualizing HBR double-bind as 6-node feedback loop. 1080p30, 880KB. Fatigue node gets special flash effect.

### Tool Validation
- **Understand dogfood on new Manim**: Ran understand.ts --dry-run on manim-workload-spiral.py — 3 excellent questions testing polar coordinates, design choices, collision avoidance. Confirms cross-language capability.

### Pipeline Status
- All 5 launch candidates rendered with BGM (ai-watches-you-eat/sleep/study/search, ai-learns-sarcasm)
- All specs pass validation
- 23 evidence sources in chain (FINAL — no more collection)

### State: 244 commits, all pushed on autopilot-0008
