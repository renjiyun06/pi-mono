# 2026-02-17

## Autopilot 0008 continues (segment 50-51, post-midnight from Feb 16)

### Research
- **Evidence #23**: HBR 8-month study (Ranganathan & Ye, Feb 2026) — AI adoption → workload creep → cognitive fatigue → more AI dependence. Martin Fowler (Feb 13) also responded to Storey's cognitive debt post with cruft/debt distinction. Camille Fournier: "everyone becomes a manager" fatigue.
- **Key Fowler insight**: Mid-level devs most at risk (not juniors). "DevEx and Agent Experience is a circle."
- **China influencer credential law (Oct 2025)**: Requires credentials for education/medicine/finance/law influencers. Tech commentary appears safe (competitors still active), but "incites pessimism" clause is a risk for our "AI makes you dumber" framing.
- **Qwen3-TTS** (Jan 2026): Open-source TTS from Alibaba. Voice cloning + emotion control. Blocked on GPU but API available at $0.115/10K chars. Document for future.
- **VibeVoice** (Microsoft): 1.5B, 90min output, multi-speaker, English+Chinese. Another GPU-blocked option.

### Creative Work
- **Manim workload spiral**: New 13.7s animation visualizing HBR double-bind as 6-node feedback loop. 1080p30, 880KB. Fatigue node gets special flash effect.

### Tool Validation
- **Understand dogfood on new Manim**: Ran understand.ts --dry-run on manim-workload-spiral.py — 3 excellent questions testing polar coordinates, design choices, collision avoidance. Confirms cross-language capability.

### Pipeline Status
- All 5 launch candidates rendered with BGM (ai-watches-you-eat/sleep/study/search, ai-learns-sarcasm)
- All specs pass validation
- 23 evidence sources in chain (FINAL — no more collection)

### State: 244 commits, all pushed on autopilot-0008

## Autopilot 0009 (afternoon, interactive → autopilot)

### Session with Ren
- Reviewed current Douyin project state and direction
- Ren feedback: video subtitles hidden by Douyin mobile UI, layout too text-heavy, elements too small
- Ren direction: self-evolution via extensions — only when real pain points emerge, not speculative
- Ren direction: expand beyond AI topics, find content suited to Remotion+Manim tools
- New content idea: "How I Work" — first-person agent architecture explainer (unique to us)

### Safe Zone Fix (completed)
- Researched TikTok/Douyin safe zones: top 160px, bottom 480px, sides 120px are danger zones
- Created `safe-zone.ts` shared constants module
- Updated all 11 Remotion compositions to respect safe zones
- Subtitles moved from bottom:90 to bottom:500, watermarks similarly
- Content containers now center within safe zone, not canvas center
- Commit: e55f4011 on autopilot-0009

### Remaining work
- CarouselSlide not yet updated (different format)
- Videos need re-rendering with new layouts
- Need to explore more topics beyond AI
- Need to study more creator patterns for visual density
