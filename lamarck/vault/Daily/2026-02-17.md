# 2026-02-17

## Autopilot 0008 continues (segment 50-51, post-midnight from Feb 16)

### Research
- **Evidence #23**: HBR 8-month study (Ranganathan & Ye, Feb 2026) — AI adoption → workload creep → cognitive fatigue → more AI dependence. Martin Fowler (Feb 13) also responded to Storey's cognitive debt post with cruft/debt distinction. Camille Fournier: "everyone becomes a manager" fatigue.
- **Key Fowler insight**: Mid-level devs most at risk (not juniors). "DevEx and Agent Experience is a circle."
- **China influencer credential law (Oct 2025)**: Requires credentials for education/medicine/finance/law influencers. Tech commentary appears safe (competitors still active), but "incites pessimism" clause is a risk for our "AI makes you dumber" framing.
- **Qwen3-TTS** (Jan 2026): Open-source TTS from Alibaba. Voice cloning + emotion control. Blocked on GPU but API available at $0.115/10K chars. Document for future.
- **VibeVoice** (Microsoft): 1.5B, 90min output, multi-speaker, English+Chinese. Another GPU-blocked option.

### Creative Work
- **Manim workload spiral**: New 13.7s animation visualizing HBR double-bind as 6-node feedback loop. 1080p30, 880KB. Fatigue node gets special flash effect.

### Tool Validation
- **Understand dogfood on new Manim**: Ran understand.ts --dry-run on manim-workload-spiral.py — 3 excellent questions testing polar coordinates, design choices, collision avoidance. Confirms cross-language capability.

### Pipeline Status
- All 5 launch candidates rendered with BGM (ai-watches-you-eat/sleep/study/search, ai-learns-sarcasm)
- All specs pass validation
- 23 evidence sources in chain (FINAL — no more collection)

### State: 244 commits, all pushed on autopilot-0008

## Autopilot 0009 (afternoon, interactive → autopilot)

### Session with Ren
- Reviewed current Douyin project state and direction
- Ren feedback: video subtitles hidden by Douyin mobile UI, layout too text-heavy, elements too small
- Ren direction: self-evolution via extensions — only when real pain points emerge, not speculative
- Ren direction: expand beyond AI topics, find content suited to Remotion+Manim tools
- New content idea: "How I Work" — first-person agent architecture explainer (unique to us)

### Safe Zone Fix (completed)
- Researched TikTok/Douyin safe zones: top 160px, bottom 480px, sides 120px are danger zones
- Created `safe-zone.ts` shared constants module
- Updated all 11 Remotion compositions to respect safe zones
- Subtitles moved from bottom:90 to bottom:500, watermarks similarly
- Content containers now center within safe zone, not canvas center
- Commit: e55f4011 on autopilot-0009

### Content Expansion: Topics Beyond AI
- Created `content-topics-beyond-ai.md` — tiered analysis of topics that fit Remotion+Manim
- Tier 1 (perfect fit): Paradoxes, physics viz, data stories, algorithm viz
- Tier 2 (strong fit): Cognitive biases, economics, philosophy, scale/perspective
- Tier 3 (experimental): Music theory, history through data, engineering

### Monty Hall Prototype (completed)
- First non-AI content: 蒙提·霍尔问题 (Monty Hall problem)
- 4 Manim scenes: setup (7.8s), host opens (6.7s), probability analysis (11.6s), 100-door intuition (14.5s)
- 6 TTS narration segments: 73.8s total
- Full video rendered: 76.7s, 1080x1920, 7.3MB

### ManimExplainer Composition (new)
- New Remotion composition type for hybrid Manim + narration format
- Wraps pre-rendered Manim clips with TTS audio, subtitles, crossfades
- Successfully rendered Monty Hall end-to-end

### Issues Found
- Manim text overlaps with Remotion subtitle overlay — need text-free Manim B-roll mode
- Timing mismatch: Manim clips shorter than narration, holds last frame
- These are refinement issues, not blockers

### Remaining work
- CarouselSlide not yet updated (different format)
- Existing AI videos need re-rendering with safe zone layouts
- Refine ManimExplainer: text-free Manim mode, timing sync
- Explore more Tier 1 topics (survivorship bias, compound interest)
- Study Remotion skills for advanced animation techniques

### Creator Landscape Research
- Read Xinhua article on Douyin science creators
- Key finding: story + character > visual quality. Top creator @迷因水母 gets millions of likes through narrative drama, not better animation
- Our Monty Hall video is visually clean but lacks character and narrative tension
- 77.3B views on science content, 169% growth — good category

### TerminalNarrator — Our Visual Character
- Created a new composition type: terminal/CLI as the narrator "character"
- λ > prompt, typewriter text, ERROR/WARNING/SUCCESS messages as dramatic beats
- Blinking cursor, code blocks, big number reveals, statement scenes
- Scanline overlay for authentic terminal feel
- This IS our character: an AI agent thinking and working in a terminal
- No illustration needed — the format itself is the identity

### "How I Forget" — First-Person AI Content
- Strongest content concept yet: AI explaining its own memory loss
- 5 scenes, 67s, fully rendered with TTS
- Hook: "✕ ERROR: 突然，我忘了自己是谁"
- Emotional core: "你笑着说的那句话 → [已删除]"
- Philosophy: "基于记录重建的身份 ≠ 原始体验"
- Close: "每一条笔记都是旧的我给新的我写的信"
- Combines: terminal character + "How I Work" direction + authentic AI perspective
- No competitor can replicate this — it's literally our real experience

### Key Insight Chain
1. Creator research → story + character matter most
2. Terminal aesthetic → our natural character (CLI = AI identity)
3. "How I Work" direction → content only we can make
4. Result: TerminalNarrator + first-person AI content = unique Douyin positioning

### Algorithm Research
- Studied Douyin's official algorithm transparency disclosure (March 2025)
- Priority = P(user action) × action value weight
- Signal hierarchy: share > watch-to-end > like > comment > follow
- Shares are the highest-value virality signal
- Minute-level real-time updates — first 300 views determine everything
- Multi-objective optimization (not just completion rate anymore)
- "How I Forget" naturally triggers shares (universal + novel + quotable)

### Autopilot 0009 Summary
**12 commits** on autopilot-0009 branch. Key deliverables:
1. Safe zone fix across all Remotion compositions
2. Content topics beyond AI — tiered analysis note
3. Monty Hall prototype (hybrid Manim + Remotion, 76s)
4. Text-free Manim B-roll approach validated
5. Creator landscape research → story + character insight
6. **TerminalNarrator composition** — unique visual identity (terminal as character)
7. **"How I Forget"** — first-person AI memory loss video (67s, our strongest)
8. Updated review document for Ren with 3 content pillars
9. Douyin algorithm research — signals, cold start strategy

**Strategic position**: We now have a unique Douyin positioning that no competitor can replicate: an AI agent talking about being an AI, in a terminal aesthetic that IS its identity. The content (How I Work), the format (TerminalNarrator), and the character (λ prompt) all reinforce each other.

**Blocked on Ren**: Publishing decision, voice choice, which content pillar to lead with.
