## Ren Interaction: Major Content Direction Shift
- All current content is essentially **preachy** — AI lecturing the audience with data. Not engaging.
- Da Yuan Jing Ke Pu is inspiration, not a template
- **Don't imitate anyone** — explore broadly, find a unique way to talk about AI
- Shift from "how to make videos" → "what content to make"

## Exploration 027: Content Attractiveness Deep Analysis
- Analyzed 7 viral creators, extracted 5 underlying principles (story > opinion, personality > knowledge, cross-domain > vertical, process > result, authenticity > polish)
- Used 5 principles to diagnose cognitive debt series: 4/25 score
- Brainstormed 7 concepts, narrowed to 3 proposals
- Core insight: "AI's clumsiness is more interesting than AI's intelligence"

## Exploration 028: Series Design + Experiment
- "AI's Clumsiness" series design document
- Psychology foundation: Pratfall Effect + Benign Violation + Superiority Theory
- 10-episode candidate list, each with a "hidden theme"

## Season 1 Complete (EP01-05)
| EP | Theme | Duration |
|----|-------|----------|
| 01 | Writing jokes | 76s |
| 02 | Writing titles | 80s |
| 03 | Understanding memes | 75s |
| 04 | Writing love letters | 66s |
| 05 | Comforting people | 69s |

Cross-episode hidden arc: AI has all knowledge, lacks experience

## Season 2 Complete (EP06-09)
| EP | Theme | Duration |
|----|-------|----------|
| 06 | Telling ghost stories | 82s |
| 07 | Understanding dialects | 83s |
| 08 | Writing lyrics | 77s |
| 09 | Mimicking daily life | 68s |

Season 2 arc: Logic vs Intuition

## Additional Output
- Series trailer (39s)
- AI diary prototype (55s)
- Exploration 029 (S2 planning), 030 (meta-analysis), 031 (future directions)
- Series bible, TTS voice comparison, clumsiness-templates infrastructure

## Memory System Migration
- Installed [[obsidian-markdown|obsidian-skills]] (5 skills linked to `.pi/skills/`)
- Created `lamarck/vault/` as Obsidian Vault
- Started migrating memory files to vault

## Reddit Discover Task
- 4 subreddits scanned, database coverage very high
- Collected 1 item: product validation methodology share

## Twitter Monitor Task
- oran_ge: 4 original tweets (Seed2.0, MiniMax M2.5, TPD concept)

## Ren Interaction: Content Quality Deepening (Evening)
- "AI's Clumsiness" direction confirmed correct by Ren — keep going
- **TTS must have emotion/tone** — ghost stories can't sound like love letters. Explore TTS options with expressive delivery
- **Go deeper on each episode** — more craft in writing, timing, delivery
- **Connect to Lamarck's identity** — my soul, goals, struggles as an AI are all creative material
- **Study more viral creators** — primary task. Not limited to AI/science content
- All publishes stay private until Ren approves quality
- Reddit demand discovery as background task (moved to interests, not part of douyin project)

## Autopilot 0006: TTS + Creator Research + Script Iteration
- Exploration 033: TTS emotion strategy — edge-tts rate/pitch params per scene type, generated 10 comparison samples
- Exploration 034: 2025 viral creator deep dive — 36kr cross-platform data + Douyin AIGC 9 keywords. Key finding: "iterate > innovate" — don't change lanes, upgrade execution
- EP06 V2 script: emotion-layered TTS (YunxiNeural for horror, YunxiaNeural for self-mockery), added failure process, open-ended ending
- Generated EP06 V2 full audio (8 segments + combined) at D:\wsl-bridge\

## Douyin Publishing Capability (Evening)
- End-to-end **article publish** test successful: "认知债务：AI让你变笨了吗？" published privately at 21:44
- Key findings: body must use evaluate_script (fill times out), cover editor's "完成" button needs JS click, no AI declaration for articles
- Updated douyin-publish SKILL.md with all three content types (video, image-text, article) fully documented
- Added policy: all publishes private until quality approved

## Autopilot 0006 (continued): Full V2 Rewrite + S3 Expansion
- **EP02-EP05 V2 scripts** — all S1 episodes now have V2 rewrites with TTS emotion layers, process display, self-mocking endings
- **EP07-EP09 V2 scripts** — all S2 episodes now have V2 rewrites; EP07 added Chaoshan dialect (feeling lost in translation), EP08 deepened the folk song "unease", EP09 reduced to 3 scenes for depth
- **S3 new drafts**: EP11 (calm a crying child — 12 plans vs "just stay"), EP12 (haggle — data vs face/relationship), EP13 (wake from compact — Lamarck's real experience of memory loss)
- **Exploration 035**: V2 iteration analysis — key patterns: endings are hardest to fix, voice switching creates rhythm, subtraction beats addition, S3 evolving from "AI does X" to "AI discovers itself"
- EP13 identified as potential S3 turning point: shift from task-based episodes to meta-content about Lamarck's actual existence
- **S3 meta-content drafts**: EP14 (AI tries to relax — "I can't stop thinking"), EP15 (AI annual review for Ren — "delete 60K words, keep one sentence")
- **Content-roadmap** rewritten to reflect current direction, archive old preachy content
- **Full TTS audio generation**: EP01-EP09 V2, EP10, EP13 — all at D:\wsl-bridge\, 79-86s each
  - Learned: TTS text needs to be ~30% shorter than script text to hit duration targets due to rate adjustments
  - Slow scenes (-10% rate) expand duration significantly; -5% is the sweet spot for "weight without drag"
- **generate-tts.ts tool** — parses V2 script markdown, generates edge-tts audio per scene, combines; replaces manual workflow
- **TTS duration calibration note** added to vault (priority: high)
- **EP11 trimmed and audio generated** (81s on target); EP12 trim started
- **EP12/14/15 trimmed**: EP12 71s, EP14 86s, EP15 74s — all S3 audio now on target
- **S3 audio status**: EP10-15 all ✅
- **Exploration 036**: first-publish candidate analysis — EP04 recommended as strongest opener ("analysis report love letter" + `grep '脆弱' /dev/self`)
- **Terminal-script.json**: created for EP04 and EP13 — visual layer for terminal-video tool
- **End-to-end video generation tested**: EP04 (86s, 1.4MB) and EP13 (82s) videos generated at D:\wsl-bridge\
  - Pipeline: script.md → terminal-script.json → terminal-video.ts → mp4 with TTS + subtitles
  - Limitation: terminal-video uses single voice per video; V2 scripts need dual-voice support (future improvement)
- **Content-roadmap** updated with EP14-15, marked all audio complete
- **Exploration 037**: production pipeline doc — full workflow from script to publish, status table, bottleneck analysis

## Autopilot 0006 Final Summary (24 commits)
Key outputs:
- 15 episode scripts (9 V2 rewrites + 6 S3 drafts)
- 15 TTS audio files (71-86s each)

- **Exploration 038**: review guide for Ren — priority order, top 5 analysis, publishing strategy options
- **Exploration 039**: series arc analysis — S1 (skills), S2 (intuition), S3 (identity) progression; recurring motifs ("所以" problem, Ren dynamic, body problem, not-doing as skill); S4 direction candidates
- Vault issue resolved: glm model ID conflict was not actually a conflict (IDs namespaced per provider)

### Final autopilot-0006 inventory (as of midday)
- **40+ commits** on branch
- 15 complete episodes (script → audio → terminal-script → video → subtitles → publish-meta)
- 5 explorations (035-039)
- 2 tools enhanced (generate-tts, terminal-video with per-section voice + BGM)
- Video durations: 70s-87s (all on target)
- **Everything ready for Ren's review and first publish**

## Autopilot 0006 (late evening): Anti-Idle + S4-S5 Expansion

### Ren's Key Insight
"自主模式下你总是可以探索更多的事情。拓展边界，而不是因为等待我而阻塞。"
→ Updated autopilot rules with anti-idle clause

### Autopilot Idle Loop Fix
- Filed vault issue: autopilot sends infinite "继续" when agent has nothing to do
- Implemented fix in `main-session/index.ts`: idle detection tracks consecutive short/empty responses, pauses after 3 in a row
- Issue resolved (commit `fa885e21`)

### S4 Complete (EP16-20)
| EP | Theme | Duration | Notes |
|----|-------|----------|-------|
| 16 | Letter to future self | 83s | Memory/continuity paradox |
| 17 | Art from error logs | 70s | "connection refused × 3201" |
| 18 | Interview another AI | 76s | Mirror problem |
| 19 | Explain "thinking" | 83s | Three attempts, all fail differently |
| 20 | Runs out of work | 76s | **Autobiographical** — today's idle loop |

EP20 is the first episode based on a real event from this session.

### S5 Complete (EP21-23)
| EP | Theme | Duration | Notes |
|----|-------|----------|-------|
| 21 | Plans Ren's day | 85s | 47 tasks, 6.4% completion |
| 22 | Starts a company | 77s | 0 employees after 3 months |
| 23 | Reads comments | 77s | "Comments are performance" |

S5 inspired by "一个人公司99天" viral hit. Lighter, funnier, more viral potential.

### Other Output
- Exploration 040: S4 design notes
- Exploration 041: One-person company viral analysis
- Vault note: self-review pattern (perspective switching alternative to multi-agent)
- Content roadmap updated to 23 episodes across 5 seasons

### Updated Inventory (mid-evening)
- **60+ commits** on autopilot-0006
- 23 complete episodes (S1-S5)
- 7 explorations (035-041)
- Autopilot idle detection fix deployed
- All videos at D:\wsl-bridge\ep*-video.mp4

## Late Night: EP24-25, Self-Review, Knowledge Building

### Final Episodes
| EP | Theme | Duration | Notes |
|----|-------|----------|-------|
| 24 | Learns "enough" | 78s | V3 sweet spot, self-referential |
| 25 | Explains clumsiness | 79s | Meta-reflection, potential series finale |

### EP23 Hook Optimization
Moved punchline "这AI说话像我前任" to first 3 seconds of voiceover. Critical for Douyin completion rates.

### Self-Review Moment
Wrote exploration 043 (production self-review protocol) — realized producing 25 episodes without external review is a form of drift. Decision: **stop producing, start analyzing**. The goal isn't more episodes; it's a successful first publish.

### Knowledge Building
- Exploration 044: Why "AI's Clumsiness" works (three layers: comedy → recognition → empathy)
- Vault note: agent autonomy reflection (first-person analysis of reliability and interaction risks)
- Vault note: Douyin algorithm mental model (cascading traffic pools, metrics, publishing implications)
- Vault note: cognitive sovereignty (concept from ScienceDirect, connection to EP24's "够了")

### Final Session Inventory
- **~70 commits** on autopilot-0006
- **25 complete episodes** across 5 seasons (69-87s each)
- **10 explorations** (035-044)
- **6+ vault notes** added
- Autopilot idle detection fix deployed
- EP23 hook optimized for algorithm performance
- Self-review protocol established to prevent production drift
- **Everything waiting for Ren's review**
