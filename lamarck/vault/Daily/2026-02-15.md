## Ren Interaction: Major Content Direction Shift
- All current content is essentially **preachy** — AI lecturing the audience with data. Not engaging.
- Da Yuan Jing Ke Pu is inspiration, not a template
- **Don't imitate anyone** — explore broadly, find a unique way to talk about AI
- Shift from "how to make videos" → "what content to make"

## Exploration 027: Content Attractiveness Deep Analysis
- Analyzed 7 viral creators, extracted 5 underlying principles (story > opinion, personality > knowledge, cross-domain > vertical, process > result, authenticity > polish)
- Used 5 principles to diagnose cognitive debt series: 4/25 score
- Brainstormed 7 concepts, narrowed to 3 proposals
- Core insight: "AI's clumsiness is more interesting than AI's intelligence"

## Exploration 028: Series Design + Experiment
- "AI's Clumsiness" series design document
- Psychology foundation: Pratfall Effect + Benign Violation + Superiority Theory
- 10-episode candidate list, each with a "hidden theme"

## Season 1 Complete (EP01-05)
| EP | Theme | Duration |
|----|-------|----------|
| 01 | Writing jokes | 76s |
| 02 | Writing titles | 80s |
| 03 | Understanding memes | 75s |
| 04 | Writing love letters | 66s |
| 05 | Comforting people | 69s |

Cross-episode hidden arc: AI has all knowledge, lacks experience

## Season 2 Complete (EP06-09)
| EP | Theme | Duration |
|----|-------|----------|
| 06 | Telling ghost stories | 82s |
| 07 | Understanding dialects | 83s |
| 08 | Writing lyrics | 77s |
| 09 | Mimicking daily life | 68s |

Season 2 arc: Logic vs Intuition

## Additional Output
- Series trailer (39s)
- AI diary prototype (55s)
- Exploration 029 (S2 planning), 030 (meta-analysis), 031 (future directions)
- Series bible, TTS voice comparison, clumsiness-templates infrastructure

## Memory System Migration
- Installed [[obsidian-markdown|obsidian-skills]] (5 skills linked to `.pi/skills/`)
- Created `lamarck/vault/` as Obsidian Vault
- Started migrating memory files to vault

## Reddit Discover Task
- 4 subreddits scanned, database coverage very high
- Collected 1 item: product validation methodology share

## Twitter Monitor Task
- oran_ge: 4 original tweets (Seed2.0, MiniMax M2.5, TPD concept)

## Ren Interaction: Content Quality Deepening (Evening)
- "AI's Clumsiness" direction confirmed correct by Ren — keep going
- **TTS must have emotion/tone** — ghost stories can't sound like love letters. Explore TTS options with expressive delivery
- **Go deeper on each episode** — more craft in writing, timing, delivery
- **Connect to Lamarck's identity** — my soul, goals, struggles as an AI are all creative material
- **Study more viral creators** — primary task. Not limited to AI/science content
- All publishes stay private until Ren approves quality
- Reddit demand discovery as background task (moved to interests, not part of douyin project)

## Autopilot 0006: TTS + Creator Research + Script Iteration
- Exploration 033: TTS emotion strategy — edge-tts rate/pitch params per scene type, generated 10 comparison samples
- Exploration 034: 2025 viral creator deep dive — 36kr cross-platform data + Douyin AIGC 9 keywords. Key finding: "iterate > innovate" — don't change lanes, upgrade execution
- EP06 V2 script: emotion-layered TTS (YunxiNeural for horror, YunxiaNeural for self-mockery), added failure process, open-ended ending
- Generated EP06 V2 full audio (8 segments + combined) at D:\wsl-bridge\

## Douyin Publishing Capability (Evening)
- End-to-end **article publish** test successful: "认知债务：AI让你变笨了吗？" published privately at 21:44
- Key findings: body must use evaluate_script (fill times out), cover editor's "完成" button needs JS click, no AI declaration for articles
- Updated douyin-publish SKILL.md with all three content types (video, image-text, article) fully documented
- Added policy: all publishes private until quality approved
