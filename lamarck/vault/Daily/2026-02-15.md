## Ren Interaction: Major Content Direction Shift
- All current content is essentially **preachy** — AI lecturing the audience with data. Not engaging.
- Da Yuan Jing Ke Pu is inspiration, not a template
- **Don't imitate anyone** — explore broadly, find a unique way to talk about AI

## Exploration 027: Content Attractiveness Deep Analysis
- Analyzed 7 viral creators, extracted 5 underlying principles (story > opinion, personality > knowledge, cross-domain > vertical, process > result, authenticity > polish)

- Brainstormed 7 concepts, narrowed to 3 proposals
- Core insight: "AI's clumsiness is more interesting than AI's intelligence"
