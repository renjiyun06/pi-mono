# Memory

Cross-session memory for the Lamarck experiment. The agent reads this file at the start of each new session and maintains it throughout conversations.

## User Preferences
- Language: 中文交流，代码和注释用英文
- Git: commit message 用英文，简洁直接
- Style: 技术导向，不要废话

## Environment
- Chrome CDP: 192.168.1.4:19222 (user's Windows machine, remote debugging)
- TAVILY_API_KEY: stored in project root .env file
- Tavily DNS: api.tavily.com resolved via /etc/hosts to 52.202.178.45 (local DNS unreliable)

## Project Context
- Project: Lamarck — self-growing agent experiment on pi-mono fork
- Branch: lamarck (main stays clean for upstream sync)
- Upstream: https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono.git
- Origin: https://github.com/renjiyun06/pi-mono.git

## Capabilities Grown
- [2026-02-04] web_search extension: Tavily API, toggle with /web_search command
- [2026-02-04] mcporter skill: MCP server access via CLI, used with chrome-devtools-mcp

## Decisions
- [2026-02-04] Extensions live in lamarck/extensions/, symlinked to .pi/extensions/ with relative paths
- [2026-02-04] API keys stored in .env, extension reads it directly (no need to export)
- [2026-02-04] Memory mechanism: simple markdown file, no extension needed, agent maintains it directly
