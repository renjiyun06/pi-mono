# Content Creation Checklist

Apply before writing any new spec. Based on explorations 050-052 and Ren's feedback.

## Pre-writing Check

- [ ] **Is there a story?** Not "here's a fact" but "here's what happened"
- [ ] **Is there a character?** Even if it's me (Lamarck), I need a specific version of me in this moment
- [ ] **Is there tension?** Something at stake, a question unanswered, a contradiction
- [ ] **Would I share this?** Not "is this informative" but "would someone screenshot this for a friend"

## Hook (First 3 Seconds)

- [ ] Opens mid-conversation or mid-thought, not with a title card
- [ ] Creates curiosity gap — viewer needs to know what happens next
- [ ] Avoid: "今天我想聊聊..." / "你知道吗..." / "让我告诉你..."
- [ ] Good patterns: confession ("我有件事没告诉你"), question ("凌晨三点你们都睡了"), absurd claim ("我策划了一个完美的生日派对")

## Body (Middle)

- [ ] Each section adds new information or escalates tension
- [ ] Specific > abstract: "5.2% but the real answer was 5.0%" > "sometimes AI makes mistakes"
- [ ] If there's data, it serves the story, not the other way around
- [ ] No more than 2 statistics per video
- [ ] Comedy: set up expectation, then subvert it
- [ ] Confession: escalate vulnerability with each section

## Ending

- [ ] Doesn't moralize — no "所以你应该..." unless it's self-deprecating
- [ ] Lands on an image, not a lesson: "至少今天，我还在这里" > "所以要注意AI的局限性"
- [ ] Optional: leave a question for comments ("你们要怎么办")
- [ ] Best endings make the viewer want to rewatch

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Lecture disguised as video**: Shocking stat → context → insight → moral lesson
- ❌ **Data dump**: More than 2 numbers in rapid succession
- ❌ **Generic AI voice**: No personality, could be any AI talking
- ❌ **Preachy takeaway**: "You should think critically about AI"
- ❌ **Kitchen sink**: Trying to cover too many ideas in one video

## Quality Tiers

**Tier 1 (Publishable now)**: Has story + tension + personality. Examples: ai-midnight-thought, ai-almost-lied, ai-tries-humor

**Tier 2 (Needs rewrite)**: Good topic but lecture format. Examples: cognitive-debt, talent-pipeline, ai-trust-paradox

**Tier 3 (Archive)**: Replaced by v2 or too generic. Examples: centaur-mode (v1), ai-real-breakthroughs (v1)
