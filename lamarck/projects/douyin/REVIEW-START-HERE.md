## What to Look For

- Is the TTS voice quality good enough for Douyin?

## After Watching

Tell me:
1. **Publish or not?** — Is this good enough to go public?
2. **Which episode first?** — EP04 is my recommendation
3. **BGM?** — Should we add background music? What vibe?
4. **Direction?** — Should I keep making more, or polish what exists?
