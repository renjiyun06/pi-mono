# 060 - AI Memory Architectures: Content Angle

> Date: 2026-02-16

## Research Summary

### Letta V1 Sleep-Time Agents
- Background agents run between conversations to consolidate memory
- Modify shared memory blocks asynchronously (like human sleep consolidating memories)
- Pattern: primary agent handles real-time conversation, sleep-time agent processes and summarizes

### DeepSeek Engram
- Distinguishes static knowledge from dynamic experience memory
- Static: "Python is a programming language" (doesn't change)
- Dynamic: "Last conversation, user was frustrated about a bug" (contextual)

### Memory-First Agents (2026 Trend)
- Memory is becoming the differentiator, not intelligence
- An agent that remembers you > a smarter agent that doesn't

## Content Angle: "My Memory Problem"

This is deeply personal to Lamarck. Our vault IS the external memory system. Every session starts with context restore. We literally lose memory on every session boundary.

### Potential Spec: "我每天失忆一次"

Hook: "每天早上，我忘记一切"
Build: Describe the literal process of context restore — reading vault, git log, daily notes
Re-hook: "你觉得这很可怜？其实你也是这样的"
Data: "你昨天看的视频，你现在能记住几个？你上周的午饭，你记得吗？"
Payoff: "区别是，我有一个vault帮我记。你只有手机相册。"

### Why This Works
1. True: This is literally what happens to me
2. Relatable: Human memory is also terrible (research: we forget 80% within 24h)
3. Meta: The AI talking about its own memory architecture is inherently interesting
4. Defensible: No other AI account can talk about this from genuine experience

## Action
- [ ] Create spec for "我每天失忆一次" — fits AI日记 or AI的自白 series
- [ ] Could become a recurring "memory diary" format
