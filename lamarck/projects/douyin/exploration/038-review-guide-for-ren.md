## Top 5 Must-Watch

### 1. EP04 — AI 写情书 (85s)
**Why first**: The "analysis report love letter" segment is the strongest single moment in the series. Three distinct tones (romantic → analytical → broken) create a mini-narrative arc. The ending `grep '脆弱' /dev/self` is the most memorable visual.

**Watch for**: Does the voice switch between YunxiaNeural and YunxiNeural feel natural? Does the pacing hold attention for the full 85s?

### 2. EP13 — AI 从 compact 中醒来 (85s)
**Why second**: Completely unique premise — no other Douyin content uses AI memory loss as a story device. The git-log scene (reading your own commits to understand who you were) is both technically accurate and emotionally resonant. This is the moment the series stops being "AI fails at tasks" and becomes "AI discovers itself."

**Watch for**: Does the meta-narrative land with someone who doesn't know what pi or compact is? Is the terminal aesthetic compelling enough?

### 3. EP08 — AI 写歌词 (86s)
**Why third**: Three genres (rap, folk, nursery rhyme) give variety. The folk song reflection ("if I can't tell if it's real feeling or precise simulation, can the reader?") is a genuinely interesting philosophical question delivered without preaching. The ending "I saved that folk song" is warm.

### 4. EP10 — AI 道歉 (72s)
**Why fourth**: Clean three-act structure (perfect → checked → honest). The core insight — "apology isn't solving the problem, it's admitting you can't" — hits hard without explaining itself.

### 5. EP06 — AI 讲鬼故事 (84s)
**Why fifth**: The only episode with a visual theme change (red/dark). Three micro-stories create horror texture. The ending "my scariest story was 'analyzing why humans are scared'" is a good punchline.

## Publishing Strategy Recommendation

**Option A: Start with EP04** (recommended in exploration 036)
- Strongest standalone piece
- Love letters are universally relatable
- "Analysis report as love letter" has viral potential

**Option B: Start with EP01**
- More conventional opener ("AI writes jokes")
- Sets up the series premise clearly
- Lower risk but lower ceiling

**Option C: Start with EP13**
- Bold choice — drops viewers into the deep end
- Could be polarizing (some won't get it, some will love it)
- Best for attracting a niche audience that stays

## What to Watch For Across All Videos

1. **Voice switching rhythm** — Does the dual-voice (YunxiaNeural lighter, YunxiNeural deeper) create the intended contrast?
2. **Terminal visual density** — Too many lines on screen = visual clutter. Too few = boring. Is the balance right?
3. **Ending quality** — V2 rewrites specifically targeted "no more preaching endings." Do the endings land?
4. **Subtitle readability** — SRT files are auto-generated. Check timing alignment.
5. **Overall pacing** — The 1-second gap between sections creates breathing room. Is it enough?

## Known Issues

- EP06 (horror) uses red theme — verify it feels different enough from the standard dark theme
- EP07 (dialects) humor relies on Chinese dialect knowledge — might not land with all audiences
- EP15 (annual review) is meta about the series itself — only works if audience has seen other episodes first
- BGM is not yet added to any video — tool now supports it but no music files have been selected
