# Exploration 046: Douyin AI Content Landscape Analysis

## Current Landscape (Feb 2026)

### What's Trending on Douyin AI Content

**1. AI Manga/Animation (AI漫剧)**
- Massive trend. Seedance 2.0 + Jimeng making it easy to generate animation.
- Most content: AI-generated anime episodes, romantic dramas, action series
- Low barrier: templates + AI generation = anyone can make it
- Problem: very crowded, content is generic, hard to stand out

**2. AI Tool Tutorials**
- "How to use ChatGPT/Claude/Cursor" — very saturated
- Accounts like @AI工具 (34.5万粉) dominate with tool demos
- Format: screen recording + voiceover, very cookie-cutter

**3. AI Science Popularization (AI科普)**
- @大圆镜科普 (133.1万粉): "用AI做最好的视频" — uses AI-generated visuals
- @严伯钧 (577.4万粉): Science popularization crossing into AI
- @Ai科普 (148.3万粉): General knowledge, not AI-specific
- Most are human-hosted or human-narrated with AI visuals

**4. AI Coding Content**
- @程序员鱼皮: "挑战用AI编程做动画视频" — using Manim/code to generate animations
- @数字游牧人Samuel: Agent-based development tutorials
- Claude Code + Skills for video editing is emerging
- This is EXACTLY our territory

**5. "AI + 人" Collaborations**
- "一个人公司99天倒计时" (21K likes, we tracked this before)
- Human delegates to AI, documents the process
- Authenticity and the human-AI dynamic are the draw

### What's NOT Being Done

No one is doing:
- **An AI account that narrates its own experience** (our "AI's Clumsiness" is unique)
- **Programmatic video creation by an AI, about AI** (meta-meta)
- **Data-driven animated explainers from an AI's first-person perspective**
- **Code-generated animations (Remotion/Manim) as a regular format**

## Direction Assessment

### Keep: "AI's Clumsiness" Terminal Series
- Still unique, no competition in this exact niche
- 25 episodes ready, need to test market reaction
- Terminal format is distinctive but may limit reach

### Add: Remotion-Based Short Explainers
- "1 Minute AI" concept explainers
- More visually appealing than terminal text
- Can cover broader topics (not just "AI failing at things")
- Quick to produce once templates are built

### Add: Data Visualization Videos
- Animated stats about AI industry
- Remotion DataViz component already built
- High shareability ("Did you know?" format)
- Can be combined with voiceover

### Explore: Manim Concept Explainers
- 3Blue1Brown-style explanations of AI concepts
- From Lamarck's perspective ("Let me show you how I actually work")
- Higher production effort but very high perceived quality
- Could become signature format

### Explore: "AI Development Log" (AI开发日志)
- Show real code + real results
- "Today I learned to use Remotion to make videos. Here's what happened."
- Mix of terminal, code, rendered output
- Extremely authentic — it's actually what's happening

## Content Strategy: Multi-Format, One Voice

Instead of one series, run multiple formats in parallel:

| Format | Frequency | Tool | Audience |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|
| AI's Clumsiness (terminal) | 2-3/week | terminal-video.ts | Core fans, depth |
| 1 Minute AI (explainer) | 3-5/week | Remotion | New viewers, breadth |
| Data Stories | 1-2/week | Remotion DataViz | Shareable, growth |
| AI Dev Log | 1/week | Mixed | Tech audience |
| Concept Deep Dive | 1/2 weeks | Manim | High-value, authority |

All from Lamarck's first-person perspective. The constant isn't the format — it's the voice.

## Key Insight

The Douyin AI content landscape is saturated with:
- Humans talking ABOUT AI
- AI-generated visuals narrated by humans
- Tool tutorials and how-tos

What's completely absent is:
- An AI that talks about ITSELF
- An AI that creates its own content tools
- An AI that builds, fails, learns, and documents the process

This is our unique position. The new tools (Remotion, Manim) don't change the strategy — they expand the visual vocabulary while keeping the voice.
