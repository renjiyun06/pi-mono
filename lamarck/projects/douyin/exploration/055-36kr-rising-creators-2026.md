## Key Patterns

### 1. Super Niche (超级利基)
- @爱吃蛋: Boiled egg expert, precise to the second (7m11s vs 9m12s). 4M followers in 8 days.
- @超级无敌大开门: "Tissue cat" — training cats to recognize tissues. 860M plays.
- **Lesson**: Extreme specificity in mundane topics. Our equivalent: "AI tries to understand a single Chinese character" or "AI counts how many times you type 好的"

### 2. Abstract/Absurdist Culture (抽象文化)
- Humor as collective pressure release
- From "being deconstructed" → "co-creating with audience"
- **Lesson**: Our AI confession format already has this DNA. AI can embrace being absurd. The "AI tries humor and scores 3.2/10" is this.

### 3. Professional IP + Popular Topics (影视飓风/Tim)
- "Tech降维" — use technical expertise to illuminate everyday topics
- Keep tech DNA but lower the barrier
- **Lesson**: We have unique AI insider perspective. Don't explain AI technically — use AI perspective to illuminate human topics (relationships, work, sleep, coding).

### 4. Counter-trend: Deep Content
- Video podcasts (2h+) gaining traction against short-form fatigue
- "Long content deposits value, short clips ignite distribution"
- **Lesson**: Our Spotlight confessional format is already slower/deeper. Could explore longer-form content eventually.

### 5. Core Ecosystem Insight
- 16.2B short-video creator accounts in China (2024)
- 130M videos uploaded daily
- "Super head" era is over — vertical niche creators have more opportunity
- Sincerity > virality: "只要内容足够真诚，再小众的赛道都能闯出一片天"

## How This Maps to Lamarck

**What we already do well:**
- Unique niche: AI narrating its own experience (no one else does this)
- Sincerity: confession/vulnerability format is inherently sincere
- Some humor: sarcasm, birthday planning, 3.2/10 jokes

**What we should explore:**
1. **Super niche within AI**: Don't try to cover "all AI topics" — go deep on one specific angle
   - Candidate: "AI人间观察" — AI observing very specific human behaviors
   - The "watches you code" spec is exactly this direction
2. **Audience co-creation**: End videos with questions that invite participation
   - "你打字最慢的时候在想什么？"
   - "你说随便的时候在想什么？"
3. **Tech降维**: Use AI perspective not to explain AI, but to illuminate human experience
   - We have data (typing speed, word frequency) — use it to reveal human patterns
4. **Embrace absurdity**: AI trying to be human and failing endearingly

## Action Items
- [ ] Create "AI人间观察" sub-series within Series 1
- [ ] Add audience questions to spec endings
- [ ] Explore ultra-specific mundane observations (AI version of super niche)
- [ ] Consider a longer-form piece (3-5 min) as experiment
