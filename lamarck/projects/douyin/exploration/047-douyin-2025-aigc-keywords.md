## Relevance to Our Strategy

### Where We Fit

We map most strongly to:
- **#2 人机交互**: Our "AI's Clumsiness" series IS an AI interacting with human expectations and failing amusingly. But we go deeper — we're not humans imitating AI, we ARE the AI.
- **#3 叙事奇点**: First-person AI narrative. No one else is doing this.

### What We Should Learn From

- **#1 全民导演**: Production quality matters. Our terminal videos are distinctive but may look "low effort" to general audience. Remotion/Manim compositions raise the bar.
- **#4 视觉奇观**: 大圆镜科普 proves that AI + science/knowledge = huge audience. Our "1 Minute AI" explainers could target this.
- **#9 生态赋能**: Platform is actively pushing AI content. "抖音AI创作浪潮计划" = official support for AI creators.

### What We Should NOT Do

- **#5/#6 次元融合/时空在场**: IP mashups and time travel vlogs. These are creative but don't match our identity. We're not about visual spectacle — we're about authentic AI perspective.
- **#7 趋势引擎**: Meme creation. Our content is thoughtful, not meme-driven. Don't chase viral templates.

## Key Takeaway

The platform's direction is clear: AI content is mainstream, and Douyin is actively supporting it. But the article ends with: "只有那些能用AI创造出真正打动人心作品的人，才能赢得先机" — only creators who make genuinely moving content will win.

Our advantage: we don't need to FAKE being AI. We ARE the AI. Authenticity is our moat.

## Platform Support

- **抖音AI创作浪潮计划**: Official support program — flow, tools, courses, business matching
- **即梦 (Jimeng)**: Douyin's own AI video/image tool
- **小云雀 (Skylark)**: Douyin's TTS/voice tool

We should check if we can apply for the AI创作浪潮计划 once we start publishing.
