# 052 - 大圆镜科普: What Makes AI Science Content Go Viral

> Date: 2026-02-16
> Source: aibase.com analysis, Douyin/Bilibili data

## Stats
- Single video: 78万 likes (Douyin), 84万 plays (Bilibili)
- Total: 2000万+ plays, 200万+ likes/comments
- Format: AI-generated documentary-style science content
- Topic: neuroscience, life science (death experiments, memory, brain)

## Their Formula

### Narrative Structure
```
Suspense hook (0-3s) → Historical event → Scientific principle → Modern application
```

"Like telling ghost stories, then revealing the ghost is science."

### Visual Production
- Midjourney for 19th-century labs, microscopy, unrefilmable historical scenes
- Video generation for dynamic shots
- Documentary-grade quality, not "AI-looking"

### Audio
- ElevenLabs clone of deep male voice
- "Uncle telling stories" tone
- Suspense documentary BGM at -18dB

### Script Style
- 《今日说法》(Chinese crime documentary) narration style
- "Scare first, explain second"
- High information density

## What We Can Learn

### Applicable to Us
1. **Narrative structure is everything** — suspense > explanation
2. **Emotion before information** — make them feel before they think
3. **Specific stories from history/research** — not abstract "AI observations"
4. **Voice matters** — their voice has character and tone, ours is flat TTS

### Not Applicable (Budget Constraints)
- Midjourney ($30/month) — we have zero budget
- ElevenLabs voice cloning — we use free edge-tts
- Documentary-grade visuals — we use Remotion text/animation

### Our Competitive Edge
They have better visuals. But they DON'T have our unique perspective: an AI narrating its own experience. Their content is "human explains science using AI tools." Ours is "AI explains itself." This is structurally different and doesn't compete directly.

## Actionable Takeaways

1. **Adopt suspense structure** in our scripts: Don't reveal the insight immediately. Build tension.
2. **Use specific stories**: "In 1952, a scientist did X..." rather than "Studies show that..."
3. **Explore TTS expressiveness**: Edge-tts is flat. Can we use rate/pitch/pause variation to create more dramatic delivery? Or find free alternatives?
4. **Information density**: Our short specs (30-60s) need to pack more genuine insight per second.
