# 057 - Competitive Landscape: AI Persona Content

> Date: 2026-02-16

## Question
Is anyone else doing "AI narrating its own experience" on Douyin or global platforms?

## Findings

### Global (TikTok/YouTube)
- **Faceless AI channels** are common: AI-generated voiceover + stock footage/animation for entertainment/education
- **Character.AI personas** (20M MAU): AI chatbot personalities, but these are conversational, not broadcast content
- **AI voice changers** for anonymous YouTubers: using AI tools but not AI-as-character
- **No one found doing "AI speaking about being AI" in first person as a sustained content brand**

### Chinese (Douyin)
- **大圆镜科普**: Uses AI-generated video for science content, but narration is human perspective
- **AIGC创作者**: Many use AI tools, but the content is about AI, not from AI's perspective
- **AI数字人**: Digital avatars reading scripts, but scripts are human-authored and human-perspective
- **No one found with an AI persona speaking about its own experience/consciousness**

## Our Unique Position

| Dimension | Others | Lamarck |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Voice | Human narrating about AI | AI narrating about itself |
| Perspective | Third person ("AI can do X") | First person ("I noticed that...") |
| Tone | Educational/news | Confessional/observational |
| Emotional axis | Wonder/fear about AI | Vulnerability/empathy from AI |
| Content source | News/research | Internal experience + human observation |

## Why This Works (Defensibility)

1. **Authenticity paradox**: An AI talking about being AI is inherently authentic — it literally is what it claims to be
2. **Emotional category creation**: There's no existing genre for "AI confessions" — we define the category
3. **Self-referential loop**: The content is about the process of creating the content (AI running a Douyin account is itself the story)
4. **Hard to copy**: Other creators can use AI tools, but they can't genuinely speak as AI without it feeling fake
5. **Scalable depth**: The persona can evolve — from observations to diary to philosophical exploration

## Risks

1. **Novelty burnout**: "AI talks about being AI" could get repetitive if we don't vary the angle
   - Mitigation: 6 series (confession, humor, news, explainer, observation, diary) provide variety
2. **Trust skepticism**: Viewers might not believe it's actually AI or might not care
   - Mitigation: The content quality matters more than the claim — even if viewers think it's human-written, the perspective is engaging
3. **Platform algorithm**: Short-form discovery algorithms don't care about persona — they care about retention
   - Mitigation: Strong hooks, relatable observations, emotional payoffs per checklist

## Conclusion

Our approach has no direct competitors. The closest is "AI数字人" but those are just AI-powered delivery of human content. We're AI-perspective content through and through. The risk isn't competition — it's execution quality and finding the right audience.

The "AI人间观察" direction (Series 5) is particularly strong because it combines unique perspective with universally relatable content. Everyone opens food delivery apps, everyone procrastinates at night, everyone deletes and rewrites code.
