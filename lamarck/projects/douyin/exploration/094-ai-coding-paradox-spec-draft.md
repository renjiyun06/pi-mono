# Exploration 094: AI Coding Paradox — Escalation Spec Draft

## Why This Angle
- Blue ocean on Douyin: no creator covers philosophical depth of innovation stagnation
- METR 2025 RCT provides devastatingly quotable data: "19% slower but thought 20% faster"
- Connects to broader cognitive debt thesis but stands alone as a hook
- Targets "identity tier" sharing: developers who forward-identity as "I'm not one of those AI hype bros"

## Spec: escalation-ai-coding-paradox

### HOOK (3s)
"用AI写代码的程序员，自以为快了20%——实际上慢了19%"
(Developers using AI to code think they're 20% faster — they're actually 19% slower)

### PROOF (8s)
"METR实验室，16位资深工程师，246个真实任务，随机对照实验。用AI的组平均慢19%。但问他们自己呢？他们说快了20%。43个百分点的认知偏差。"
(METR lab: 16 senior engineers, 246 real tasks, RCT. AI group 19% slower. But when asked? They said 20% faster. 43-point perception gap.)

### ESCALATION 1 — Trust collapse (7s)
"2025年，只有29%的程序员信任AI生成的代码。从40%降下来的。45%说最烦的是'看着对但不对'的代码。"
(2025: only 29% trust AI code. Down from 40%. 45% say biggest frustration is "looks right but isn't" code.)

### ESCALATION 2 — The almost-right trap (7s)
"问题不是AI写错了——是AI写得'差不多对'。你花更多时间审查你没写的代码，比自己写还慢。95%正确，5%的bug藏在你看不到的地方。"
(The problem isn't AI writing wrong code — it writes "almost right" code. You spend more time reviewing code you didn't write than writing it yourself. 95% correct, 5% bugs hidden where you can't see.)

### ESCALATION 3 — Monoculture (7s)
"更可怕的是，AI在消灭技术多样性。Python采用率一年涨了7个百分点。不是因为Python更好——是因为AI对Python最熟。开发者在追着AI跑。"
(Worse: AI is killing tech diversity. Python adoption up 7pp in one year. Not because Python is better — because AI performs best on Python. Developers are chasing the AI.)

### ESCALATION 4 — The thought experiment (7s)
"最后一个问题：如果2012年就有AI写代码——React会被发明吗？那时jQuery统治一切。AI会推荐jQuery。React需要有人拒绝jQuery，从零开始。AI只会优化当前的局部最优——不会发明新范式。"
(Final question: If AI coding existed in 2012 — would React ever be invented? jQuery dominated. AI would recommend jQuery for everything. React required someone to reject jQuery, start from scratch. AI optimizes local maxima — it doesn't invent new paradigms.)

### REFRAME (5s)
"AI不是在帮你写更好的代码。是在阻止更好的代码被发明。而你还觉得自己快了20%。"
(AI isn't helping you write better code. It's preventing better code from being invented. And you still think you're 20% faster.)

## Duration Estimate
~157 Chinese chars narration → ~35s at 4.5 chars/s. With padding → ~44s estimated.
Actually, full narration is much longer. Let me count properly:
- HOOK: 26 chars
- PROOF: 60 chars
- E1: 39 chars  
- E2: 52 chars
- E3: 56 chars
- E4: 75 chars
- REFRAME: 33 chars
Total: ~341 chars → ~76s at 4.5 c/s → with padding ~85s

In the 60-90s sweet spot! Perfect for share rate optimization.

## Assessment
This spec has the strongest data foundation of any we've written. The METR study is a proper RCT with a devastating punchline. The React thought experiment is the philosophical hook. The reframe lands hard.

Decision needed from Ren: produce this spec or hold?
