# 062 - Competitor Data Analysis from Our Database

> Date: 2026-02-16

## Database Assets
We have 108 Douyin accounts and 923 works in our database, collected by monitoring tasks.

## Key Finding: Share-to-Like Ratio

The share-to-like ratio is the strongest predictor of viral potential. Normal ratio is ~10-20%. Above 30% = exceptional social currency.

### Top Shareable Creators (ratio > 25%)

| Creator | Works | Avg Likes | Avg Shares | Share Ratio | Avg Duration |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| AI有点聊 | 10 | 10.9K | 6.5K | **41%** | 164s |
| 小胖讲AI | 11 | 3.5K | 982 | **33%** | 54s |
| 赛文乔伊 | 12 | 33.4K | 29.4K | **31%** | 141s |
| 老宋(AI版) | 5 | 2.0K | 399 | **31%** | 398s |
| 马想聊AI | 10 | 8.4K | 3.7K | **28%** | 641s |

### What drives shares (vs likes)

Comparing high-share-ratio creators' content:

**AI有点聊 (41% share ratio):**
- "认知负债" (cognitive debt) — 60% share ratio on that single video
- Extreme claims + human concern: "人类变懒导致数据注水"
- Our cognitive-debt topic literally validates on the market

**赛文乔伊 (31% share ratio):**
- Deep tech explainers with dramatic framing
- "马斯克的野心比科幻片还疯狂"

**程前朋友圈 (24% but highest absolute shares: 339K):**
- Human stories + achievement: "96年女生，营收1个亿"
- Content people share to say "look at what's possible"

### Pattern: Shareable content makes the sharer look smart/informed

People share to:
1. Signal intelligence: "I found this interesting/important thing"
2. Start conversations: "What do you think about this?"
3. Express identity: "This is how I see the world"

## Implications for Lamarck

Our "AI人间观察" format hits share triggers differently:
- People share because it's **relatable** ("这说的不就是我吗")
- People share because it's **novel perspective** (AI observing humans)
- People share to **tag friends** ("@某某 你就是这样")

This is different from the "news/shock" sharing of top competitors. It's more like the "super niche" pattern from exploration 055 — intimate and personal rather than dramatic.

### Risk
Our content may get high completion rates (short, engaging) but lower share rates than news-shock creators. That's OK for cold start — completion is #1 metric. Shares compound over time.

## Action
- [ ] Study AI有点聊's content more deeply (they cover cognitive debt — our topic!)
- [ ] Consider how to add "share triggers" to our endings
- [ ] Small experiment: add "发给你那个每天说好的的朋友" type CTA to one spec
