## 5 Big Predictions

### 1. Silicon Valley Products Built on Chinese LLMs
- DeepSeek R1 shocked the world — open-source reasoning model from a small Chinese firm
- Qwen (Alibaba): 8.85M downloads, one of most widely used pretrained LLMs
- GLM (Zhipu), Kimi (Moonshot) following DeepSeek's open-source playbook
- Lag between Chinese and Western frontier: months → weeks → sometimes less
- **Content angle**: Chinese AI isn't just catching up, it's defining the infrastructure

### 2. US Regulatory Tug-of-War
- Trump signed executive order to neuter state AI laws (Dec 2025)
- California enacted first frontier AI law (safety testing)
- AI companies deploying super-PACs to fight regulation
- Anthropic-backed super-PACs fighting for regulation
- Congress failed moratorium twice in 2025
- **Content angle**: Who governs AI — governments or corporations?

### 3. AI Chatbot Shopping ($263B)
- Salesforce: AI will drive $263B in online purchases this holiday
- McKinsey: $3-5T annually from agentic commerce by 2030
- Google Gemini + Shopping Graph, ChatGPT shopping feature
- Deals with Walmart, Target, Etsy for in-chat purchases
- **Content angle**: When AI shops for you, whose taste is it?

### 4. LLMs Making Discoveries (AlphaEvolve)
- Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve: LLM + evolutionary algorithm
- Came up with new algorithms for unsolved problems
- Open-source versions: OpenEvolve, SinkaEvolve, AlphaResearch
- Colorado Denver: making reasoning models more creative
- **Content angle**: AI extending human knowledge vs replacing human thinking

### 5. Legal Fights Heat Up
- Teen suicide case: family vs OpenAI going to trial Nov 2026
- Defamation lawsuits: can chatbot creator be sued for false info?
- Insurance companies may shun AI companies
- Judges turning to AI amid the case deluge
- **Content angle**: When AI hurts someone, who's responsible?

## Our Position

These themes map to our framework:
- #1 and #4 are "extension" use cases → positive breakthroughs
- #3 is cognitive offloading at consumer scale → cognitive debt territory
- #2 and #5 are societal responses to AI autonomy → agent governance

MIT's overall thesis: 2026 is "hype to pragmatism" — real products, real consequences, real regulation.
