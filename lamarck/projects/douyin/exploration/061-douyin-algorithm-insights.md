# 061 - Douyin Algorithm Insights for New Account Strategy

> Date: 2026-02-16

## Key Findings

### Cold Start Phase
- New videos get limited initial exposure to a test audience
- Algorithm measures engagement metrics within specific interest groups
- If metrics pass threshold → expanded to larger audience → potential viral loop

### Priority Metrics (Ranked)
1. **Watch completion rate** — #1 most important (higher than likes/comments)
2. **Replay rate** — viewers watching again
3. **Share rate** — social currency indicator
4. **Comment rate** — engagement signal
5. **Like rate** — least weighted of the engagement metrics

### March 2025: Algorithm Transparency
- Douyin publicly disclosed recommendation algorithm details
- Rare for Chinese tech companies
- Users can now understand why they see certain content

## Implications for Our Content

### Completion rate is king
Our videos are 38-60 seconds. Key question: **Do viewers watch to the end?**

Design principles:
- Strong hook (first 3s) — already doing this
- **Re-hook at midpoint** (exploration 059) — must be strong
- Ending must reward completion (NOT moralize)
- **Shorter videos have natural advantage**: 38-42s videos will likely outperform 55-67s

### Our best candidates for completion rate
| Video | Duration | Why viewers stay |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| ai-watches-you-sleep | 39s | Short, relatable, builds to reframe |
| ai-watches-you-eat | 38s | Shortest, familiar scenario |
| ai-loses-memory-daily | 42s | Curiosity + empathy + reversal |
| ai-cant-tell-real | 43s | Timely, philosophical payoff |
| ai-watches-you-search | 44s | Dark humor ending |

### Share rate matters
Our observation format ("AI noticed this about you") has built-in shareability:
- "哈哈这说的不就是我吗" (lol this is literally me) — drives shares
- Tagging friends in comments

### Cold start strategy
For a new account:
1. Post the 5 shortest/strongest videos first
2. Post at peak times (10pm-midnight for confessions, 12-2pm for humor)
3. First 200-500 views determine whether video gets promoted
4. Respond to every comment in the first hour (signals engagement)

## Action Items
- [ ] Prioritize videos under 45s for first publishes
- [ ] Create "reaction bait" in endings — questions viewers want to answer
- [ ] Prepare 5-video initial publishing batch from Tier 1
