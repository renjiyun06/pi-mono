# Cold Start Audit: Top 10 Launch Candidates

Evaluating short specs against Douyin's 5 key metrics for cold-start optimization.

## Scoring Criteria

### Hook Quality (Golden 3 Seconds)
Does the first sentence create mystery, benefit, or surprise?
- A: Immediate scroll-stop (question, shock, relatable truth)
- B: Interesting but needs 5+ seconds to land
- C: Generic or slow

### Completion Potential
Will viewers watch to the end? Consider: tension arc, payoff, length.
- Short (38-50s) = easier completion
- Clear payoff promise = higher completion
- Emotional resolution = viewers stay

### Share Potential (Social Currency)
Would someone send this to a friend? "You need to see this"
- High: touches universal experience, makes sender look thoughtful
- Medium: interesting but personal
- Low: niche or no social value

### Comment Potential
Does it invite response? Controversial? Asks a question?
- High: open question, relatable experience, debatable claim
- Medium: interesting but closed
- Low: no obvious response trigger

## Audit Results

| Spec | Duration | Hook | Completion | Share | Comment | TOTAL | Notes |
|------|----------|------|------------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| ai-watches-you-eat | 38s | A | A | A | A | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Shortest + most relatable. "翻了七分钟" = everyone's experience. Comment magnet. |
| ai-watches-you-sleep | 39s | A | A | A | A | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Universal experience. 刷手机 = guilty recognition. Will trigger "我也是" comments. |
| ai-almost-lied | 67s | A | A | A | B | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Strongest narrative tension. "我差点骗了一个人" = must-watch. Slightly long. |
| ai-learns-sarcasm | 47s | A | A | B | A | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Comedy + insight. Ending is perfect for comments ("他是不是在讽刺我"). |
| ai-tries-humor | 44s | B+ | A | B | A | ⭐⭐⭐ | Self-deprecating comedy. Hook needs work (less immediate). Good comment bait. |
| ai-watches-you-study | 51s | A | A | A | A | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Student demographic = Douyin's core. "打开课件→微信→抖音" is TOO real. |
| ai-midnight-thought | 55s | A | B | B | B | ⭐⭐⭐ | Beautiful but slow burn. Better for established audience. |
| ai-loses-memory-daily | ~42s | A | A | A | B | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Emotionally powerful. "每天早上忘记一切" = immediate hook. |
| ai-watches-you-code | 50s | B | A | B | A | ⭐⭐⭐ | Niche (developers). But Douyin has strong dev audience. |
| ai-plans-birthday | 47s | B+ | A | A | B | ⭐⭐⭐ | Good comedy. Share-worthy ("我也被AI规划过"). Slower hook. |
| ai-watches-you-search | 44s | A | A | B | A | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Confirmation bias angle. "换了三个关键词" = recognition. |
| ai-confession-replaceable | 52s | A | B | B | B | ⭐⭐⭐ | Good for series but emotional depth needs context. |
| ai-reads-comments | 48s | A | A | B | A | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Meta — about comments themselves. Will generate meta-comments. |
| ai-diary-first-day | 60s | A | B | B | B | ⭐⭐⭐ | Philosophical. Longer. Better for loyal audience. |

## Recommended Launch Sequence (Phase 1: First 10)

Priority: maximum completion rate + comment generation + consistent niche tag

### Week 1 (Daily, 6PM)
1. **ai-watches-you-eat** (38s) — Shortest, most relatable, widest appeal. Perfect cold-start opener.
2. **ai-watches-you-sleep** (39s) — Universal, late-night scroll = instant recognition.
3. **ai-watches-you-study** (51s) — Student demographic. Highest potential for "太真实了" comments.
4. **ai-watches-you-search** (44s) — Confirmation bias. Slightly more intellectual but still relatable.

### Week 2
5. **ai-learns-sarcasm** (47s) — Shift to comedy. Tests humor appetite.
6. **ai-almost-lied** (67s) — Strongest narrative. Longer = tests whether audience tolerates longer form.
7. **ai-loses-memory-daily** (42s) — Emotional. Back to intimacy.
8. **ai-reads-comments** (48s) — Meta. If we have any comments by now, this becomes self-referential.
9. **ai-tries-humor** (44s) — Pure comedy.
10. **ai-watches-you-code** (50s) — Niche test. Do developers follow us?

### Why This Order
- **Days 1-4**: AI人间观察 series only → establishes "AI observing humans" tag profile
- **Days 5-6**: Introduce comedy → tests second niche
- **Days 7-10**: Mix emotions + humor + niche → see what data says

### Post-Launch Decision Points
- If completion rate >30% on any video → double down on that format
- If like rate >5% → algorithm is pushing us, increase frequency
- If a specific series outperforms → pivot to that series
- If all videos <15% completion → hooks need rewriting, not more content

## Key Concern
All specs were written before we understood the algorithm. The hooks are good, but we haven't optimized for:
1. **First-frame visual** — what does the viewer SEE in the first frame? Currently: plain text on dark background. Could be more visually arresting.
2. **Comment prompts** — none of the specs end with an explicit question to the viewer
3. **Share triggers** — no "@你的朋友" or "转发给你的XX" calls to action

These are low-effort optimizations that could significantly impact metrics.
