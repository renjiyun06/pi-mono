# Exploration 095: Competitor Analysis — AI有点聊

## Discovery
"AI有点聊" is a direct competitor in the cognitive debt content space on Douyin. They already made a video using the exact term "认知负债" (cognitive debt).

## Their Cognitive Debt Video
**Title**: "两篇学术论文表明：人类陷入'认知负债'，AI陷入'近亲繁殖'"
**Stats**: 19,276 likes, 11,667 shares (60.5% share rate)
**Framing**: Entertaining narrative — "intelligence explosion may never happen" because humans getting lazy → bad data → AI degrades → worse AI

## Their Content Strategy
| Video | Likes | Shares | Share% | Angle |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Clawdbot "cyber Jarvis" | 65K | 44K | 68.4% | Entertaining AI agent demo |
| 认知负债 + AI近亲繁殖 | 19K | 11.6K | 60.5% | Academic papers → entertaining narrative |
| Living to 1000 | 4.6K | 2.6K | 55.8% | Futurism / longevity |
| Gemini 3 documentary | 11K | 2.0K | 17.7% | AI doc review |
| 一人公司 | 3.5K | 1.6K | 45.4% | Hustle culture + AI |

**Profile**: 10 videos, 10.9K avg likes, 59.2% share rate. This is very strong.

## Differentiation
Their approach is **entertaining narrative** — hyperbolic, exclamation-mark-heavy, culture-war framing ("比尔·盖茨力挺!", "百万美金悬赏!").

Our approach is **data-driven analysis** — METR RCT, 22-source evidence chain, specific stats (43-point perception gap, 29% trust), philosophical depth (React thought experiment).

They're the AI哔哩哔哩 (entertaining takes). We're the 3Blue1Brown (rigorous explanation).

## Implications
1. **Market validation**: "认知负债" gets 60% share rate on Douyin — the topic works
2. **Positioning**: We're NOT competing head-to-head. Their tone is "holy shit AI is wild!", ours is "here's what the data shows"
3. **Advantage**: They reference 2 papers vaguely. We have 22 sources with specific data. Depth > breadth when the algorithm favors completion rate.
4. **Risk**: If they've already covered 认知负债, our content needs to be clearly differentiated (data, depth, Understand product tie-in)

## Action
This changes nothing about our strategy — it validates it. The AI Coding Paradox spec (METR data) is content they haven't and probably wouldn't make, because it requires reading a 12-minute BayTech analysis and extracting specific numbers. That's our lane.
