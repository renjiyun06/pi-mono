# Exploration 072: Share Rate Analysis — What Makes People Press "Forward"

**Date**: 2026-02-16
**Question**: What content characteristics drive sharing (not just liking) on Douyin?

## Method

Analyzed 923 works from 108 accounts in our database. Focused on share-to-like ratio as the key social currency metric.

## Key Findings

### Top Sharers in Our Database
| Account | Share Rate | Avg Duration | Content Type |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 赛文乔伊 | 88.1% | 141s | Tech news + analysis |
| 杨博士说AI | 45.4% | 159s | Science breakthroughs |
| Ai风向标 | 44.2% | 289s | AI predictions/commentary |
| 程前朋友圈 | 27.9% | 764s | Celebrity interviews |
| Xuan酱 | 26.9% | 512s | AI tool tutorials |

### Most Shared Individual Videos
1. **105.9% share rate** — "96年女生退休" (aspirational/financial, 787s)
2. **154.6% share rate** — "脑机接口" (provocative tech, 81s)
3. **77.6% share rate** — "Manus实测" (trending tool, 40s)
4. **51.3% share rate** — "马斯克2026奇点" (scary prediction, 245s)
5. **50.4% share rate** — "假视频包围" (scary warning, 249s)

### Three Share Triggers

**1. "This Changes Everything" (provocative tech news)**
- Brain-computer interface (155% share rate, 81s)
- NVIDIA GTC three-pronged attack (31%, 106s)
- Digital employees arrive (18%, 111s)
- Pattern: short-medium length, one massive implication, urgency

**2. "Holy Shit Look at This" (mind-blowing demos)**
- Manus实测 (78% share rate, 40s)
- AI生图Banana (35%, 375s)
- Pattern: visual proof of something unbelievable, tool-first

**3. "You Need to Know This" (urgent warnings/insights)**
- 假视频包围 (50% share rate, 249s)
- 癌细胞标记为猪细胞 (47%, 168s)
- 马斯克奇点预言 (51%, 245s)
- Pattern: fear or urgency, medium length, established credibility

### What Does NOT Get Shared
- Tutorials and reviews (1.9-4.9% share rate)
- Deep educational content (unless it has a "holy shit" moment)
- Content that requires context to appreciate

### The Anti-Pattern: 赛文乔伊
This account averages 88.1% share rate overall but their TUTORIAL content (AI music, AI video) gets 1.9-4.9%. Same creator, same audience, same quality — but educational = low sharing, provocative = viral sharing.

## Implications for Our Strategy

### Current Approach Problems
Our DeepDives are educational deep dives. Based on this data, they will get VIEWS (completion rate matters) but NOT SHARES. Shares require the "holy shit" trigger.

### Cold Start Fix
For the first 10 videos (cold start phase), we need share triggers:
1. Lead with the most provocative data point ("17% skill loss in controlled experiment")
2. Frame as warning ("Your brain is literally rewiring itself — this is not a metaphor")
3. Keep under 90 seconds for maximum share rate
4. End with "forward this to your developer friend" CTA

### DeepDive Positioning
DeepDives work for RETENTION (completion rate, follow conversion) but not VIRAL SPREAD. They should come AFTER we have followers, not during cold start.

This reinforces the cold-start strategy from exploration 071: short, punchy, shareable videos first → build audience → then deploy DeepDives for depth.

### One Exception
If a DeepDive has a "holy shit" data point in the first 3 seconds AND is under 3 minutes, it might share well. The brain-rewiring topic qualifies: "A controlled study of 52 programmers found AI users scored 17% lower — and experience level didn't matter."

## Updated Content Priority

For cold start (first 10 videos):
1. **AI rewires your brain** — 60s version of the 17% finding
2. **"I move fast but lost my passion"** — ICSE quote + burnout data
3. **Your code, you still understand it?** — cognitive debt hook
4. **AI人间观察: 吃饭** — relatable humor (different share trigger: "this is so me")

For growth phase (post-100 followers):
5-10. DeepDive series as retention content
