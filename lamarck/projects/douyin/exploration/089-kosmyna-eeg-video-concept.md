# Exploration 089: Kosmyna EEG Study — Strongest Video Concept Yet

## Source
MIT Media Lab, Kosmyna et al., 2025. "Your Brain on ChatGPT." CNN/New Yorker/Nature coverage.

## Why This Is Different
Previous evidence was surveys, self-reports, or single-session experiments. This study:
- **Measured brains directly** (EEG, not self-report)
- **4 months longitudinal** (not one session)
- **Swap experiment** proving persistent damage
- **"Cognitive debt" in the paper title** — the academic term matches our brand
- **Mainstream media coverage** — audience already primed

## Video Concept: "他们把ChatGPT从学生手里拿走了，然后测了他们的大脑"

### Narrative Arc (Escalation Format)
1. **HOOK** (3s): "MIT做了一个残酷的实验" / "MIT ran a cruel experiment"
2. **SETUP** (10s): 54 students, 3 groups, 4 months, EEG helmets
3. **FINDING 1** (8s): LLM users = weakest brain connectivity. Visual: 3 brain networks fading
4. **ESCALATION**: "But here's the cruel part..."
5. **FINDING 2** (10s): Session 4 — they TOOK AWAY ChatGPT. Students couldn't recover. Alpha/beta connectivity still suppressed.
6. **ESCALATION**: "They couldn't even quote their own essays"
7. **FINDING 3** (8s): LLM users didn't know what "they" wrote. Lowest ownership.
8. **REFRAME** (10s): "CNN报道了这个研究。The New Yorker的标题是：'AI正在让我们的思维趋同'" — links to monoculture
9. **CLOSE**: "这不是假设，这是测量出来的" / "This isn't a hypothesis. It's a measurement."

### Why Escalation Not DeepDive
- DeepDive = educational, high completion challenge
- Escalation = share-optimized, shock value
- This study's findings are shocking enough to carry escalation format
- Target: 90-120 seconds

### Manim Visual Opportunities
- Brain connectivity network: 3 versions (strong/moderate/weak)
- EEG alpha/beta band visualization
- Swap experiment flowchart (groups crossing)

### Not Producing This Now
Per no-for-loop rule: concept noted, awaiting Ren's direction on video format.
