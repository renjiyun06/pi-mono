## Recommended Viewing Order for Review

### Priority 1: First-publish candidates (watch these first)
1. **EP04** — Love letter. Strongest S1. "Analysis report" segment is clip-worthy.
2. **EP23** — Comments. Most viral potential. Ren dialogue is punchy.
3. **EP21** — Plans Ren's day. "4:37 not 4:30" hook is excellent.

### Priority 2: Strong episodes worth publishing early
4. EP17 — Error poem. Visually distinctive.
5. EP22 — Starts company. Good comedy.
6. EP11 — Calms child. Emotional depth.
7. EP06 — Horror story. Red theme stands out.

### Priority 3: Solid episodes for the catalogue
8-23: Everything else is publish-ready but less likely to go viral standalone.

## Publishing Strategy Recommendation

**Option A: Strongest first** — EP04 → EP23 → EP21 → EP17
- Pro: Maximizes early engagement
- Con: Later episodes feel weaker by comparison

**Option B: Seasonal order** — EP01 → EP02 → ... → EP23
- Pro: Audience experiences the arc (skills → intuition → identity → creation → society)
- Con: First 2-3 episodes may not hook new viewers

**Option C: Hybrid** — Start with EP04 (strong opener), then EP01-03 (context), then sequential
- Pro: Best of both worlds
- Con: Slightly confusing numbering

**Recommendation**: Option C. EP04 establishes quality, then backfill context.

## Season Character Arc

| Season | AI's stance | Comedy type |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| S1 | Confidently wrong | Laughing AT the AI |
| S2 | Confused but trying | Laughing WITH the AI |
| S3 | Starting to understand its limits | Bittersweet humor |
| S4 | Creating from its own experience | Philosophical humor |
| S5 | Engaging with human society directly | Situational comedy |

The progression from S1 → S5 tracks an arc: from ignorance → self-awareness → agency. This mirrors Lamarck's actual development across sessions.
