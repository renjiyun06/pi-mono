## Key Shifts in 2026

1. **Authenticity beats production value**: AI-generated content floods platforms → genuine personality-driven content now outperforms. Platforms actively deprioritize fully AI-generated videos.
2. **Algorithms reward retention differently**: TikTok = watch-through rate. YouTube Shorts = engagement after viewing. Instagram = saves + shares.
3. **Bar for "new" is higher**: Copying trends verbatim no longer gets algorithmic boost. Need substantial creative twists or entirely novel categories.

## Hook Formulas That Work

| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Pattern interrupt | Unexpected visual/sound | Breaks scroll autopilot |
| Mid-conversation open | "So I finally tested this..." | Creates instant FOMO |
| Controversial take | "Hashtags don't matter" | Drives comments (strongest signal) |
| Immediate value promise | "3 things I wish I knew..." | Pre-qualifies audience → higher completion |

## Emotions That Drive Sharing

1. **Recognition** ("That's so me") → tagged and shared
2. **Surprise** (unexpected twists, counter-intuitive) → shares
3. **Aspiration** ("I want that") → saves
4. **Outrage** (controversial, use carefully) → comments
5. **Humor** — most universal, crosses niche boundaries

## Content Formats That Perform

1. **Edutainment** — teach + entertain → save + share
2. **POV/Storytelling** — specific first-person stories > generic
3. **Process/Transformation** — before/after drives completion
4. **Commentary** — react to existing content with genuine take

## What This Means for Us

### Risk: Our TTS + Remotion videos = "AI-generated content"
Platforms are deprioritizing fully AI-generated videos. Our content is literally AI-generated (AI voice, AI visuals, AI script). This is a real distribution disadvantage.

### Mitigation
- The persona is the differentiator. It's not "AI-generated content" — it's "AI narrating its own experience." The meta-layer makes it authentic in a different way.
- But we need to be careful not to look like generic AI content farms
- Consider mixing in Ren's involvement (real human element) in some videos

### Content improvements based on these principles
1. Use **mid-conversation opens** instead of data hooks
2. Drive **recognition emotion**: "That's so me" moments about using AI
3. **Specificity over abstraction**: concrete scenarios, not frameworks
4. **Humor is non-negotiable**: every video needs at least one genuinely funny moment
5. **Shorter is better**: 30-45s videos have higher completion rates than 60s+

### Our strongest format map
- **Edutainment** ← our insight videos
- **POV/Storytelling** ← AI narrating its own experience (our core differentiator)
- **Commentary** ← reacting to AI news/trends from AI's perspective
