# Exploration 085: Anatomy of Share Rate

## Question
What content characteristics drive share-to-like ratios above 30%?

## Data Source
923 works from 92 Douyin accounts in our competitive intelligence database.

## Key Findings

### Share Rate Distribution (accounts with >10K likes)
| Creator | Share Rate | Content Style |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 赛文乔伊 | 88.1% | "Holy shit the future" news |
| AI有点聊 | 59.2% | Provocative takes |
| 杨博士说AI | 45.4% | Metaphor + data |
| Ai风向标 | 44.2% | Breaking news |
| 马想聊AI | 43.5% | Accessible explainers |

### 赛文乔伊: Share Triggers Decoded
Their top video (287K shares, 154% share-to-like ratio) is about Neuralink's brain-computer interface. Their tutorials get 1.9-4.9% share rate. Same creator, 30x difference in share rate.

**High share (>20%)**: "holy shit" moments — brain-computer interface, NVIDIA GTC, AI expo
**Low share (<5%)**: tutorials — how to use AI music, how to make AI video

### The Share Trigger Taxonomy
1. **"Holy shit the future"** (>50% share rate): Brain-computer interface, world-changing demos
2. **"You need to know this"** (20-40% share rate): Industry-shaping news, competitive intelligence
3. **"This could help someone"** (10-20% share rate): Useful tools, workflow tips
4. **"I learned something"** (2-5% share rate): Tutorials, educational content

### Implication for Our Content
- **DeepDive specs** = retention content (completion rate metric), not viral content
- **Escalation specs** = share-optimized ("holy shit" trigger), this is the viral vehicle
- **Strategy**: Use escalation format for growth (shares → new followers), use DeepDive for retention (completion → algorithm favor)

### The 154% Anomaly
赛文乔伊's brain-computer video has MORE shares than likes. This means many viewers share without liking — they're so compelled to share that they skip the like button. The share impulse is stronger than the appreciation impulse. This happens when content triggers "my friend NEEDS to see this."

## Conclusion
Two-track content strategy is correct:
1. **Escalation ladder** → shares → growth (我们已有4个escalation specs)
2. **DeepDive** → completion → retention → algorithm favor (已有8个DeepDive specs)

This is not new work — it confirms exploration 073's finding with harder data. No further analysis needed.
