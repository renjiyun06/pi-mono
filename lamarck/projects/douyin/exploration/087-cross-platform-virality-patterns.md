# Exploration 087: Cross-Platform Virality Patterns

## Data Sources
- Douyin: 923 works from 92 accounts
- Twitter: 876 posts from ~90 accounts
- Zhihu Hot: 1270 snapshots
- Zhihu KOL: 730 activities
- Topics DB: 46 curated topics
- Reddit: 158 posts

## Core Finding: The Share Rate Hierarchy

Analyzing share/repost rates across platforms reveals a consistent hierarchy:

### Tier 1: "Holy Shit" Content (50-155% share rate)
- **Douyin**: 赛文乔伊 brain-computer interface (154.6%), 程前朋友圈 "30岁退休" (105.9%)
- **Twitter**: Twin launch with RT CTA (48.0%), oran_ge "互联网已死" (30.5%)
- **Zhihu**: One-person AI company (523万 peak, 23 snapshots = multi-day virality)
- **Pattern**: Breaking news or "impossible" personal stories. Forwarded as "you MUST see this"

### Tier 2: Identity/Emotional Content (10-30% share rate)
- **Douyin**: AI有点聊 cognitive debt video (60.5%), Rick讲AI实战 "国家怎么看AI对就业" (50.7%)
- **Twitter**: Simon Willison burnout observation (16.7% repost), ibab xAI departure (8.3%)
- **Zhihu**: Man finds grandmother's stone in ruins (449万 heat), emotional resonance
- **Pattern**: "This describes ME" or "This is someone I know." Shared to validate feelings.

### Tier 3: Educational/Tutorial (1-5% share rate)
- **Douyin**: Most tutorial accounts average 1.9-4.9% share rate
- **Twitter**: Technical threads average 5-15% repost rate
- **Pattern**: Saved/bookmarked but rarely shared. "I'll use this later."

## Cross-Platform Signals

### Zhang Wenhong Medical AI Warning (Zhihu, 6474 upvotes)
China's most famous infectious disease doctor opposes AI in medical records — fears diagnostic ability loss. This is cognitive debt in medicine. The top response is sarcastic but the 6474 upvotes show massive public interest in AI deskilling beyond tech.

**Content angle**: "连张文宏都在担心AI让医生变笨" (Even Zhang Wenhong worries AI makes doctors dumber). Bridges our tech audience to mainstream medical concern. High share potential: identity ("I'm worried too") + authority (Zhang Wenhong) + fear ("this affects MY doctor").

### "一个人公司" (Zhihu, 523万 heat, 23 snapshots)
Dominated hot list for DAYS. Our spec `one-person-company.json` addresses this exact topic but from the RISK angle. While everyone covers opportunity, we cover cognitive debt. Counter-narrative = high share potential.

### Musk Predictions (Douyin 143K likes, 51.3% share; Zhihu multiple entries)
Cross-platform amplification of Musk content. "2026年人类社会将被彻底重启" gets massive engagement on both platforms. We don't need to make Musk content, but could reference when it overlaps with our thesis.

## Strategic Implications

1. **Two-track content confirmed by data**: Escalation format for Tier 1 (viral growth), DeepDive for Tier 3 (authority/retention). We need BOTH.

2. **Missing Tier 2**: We have no "identity" content yet. Our AI人间观察 series (eat, sleep, study) could be this — "this describes MY relationship with AI." The engagement pattern is different: not "holy shit" shares but "this is so me" shares.

3. **Medical angle is untapped**: Zhang Wenhong's AI deskilling concern validates our framework beyond tech. A video connecting medical AI warnings to our cognitive debt thesis would cross-pollinate audiences.

4. **Counter-narrative wins**: The one-person company is universally covered as opportunity. Our RISK angle would stand out — "everyone's celebrating but nobody's asking what you lose."

5. **Twitter insight: humor > gravity**: svpino's one-liner (42K likes, 0.81% engagement) vs long technical threads (0.3-0.4%). Short, punchy, quotable > comprehensive. Our escalation format aligns.

## Recommended Next Actions
- Consider medical cognitive debt spec (Zhang Wenhong hook)
- Ensure AI人间观察 series emphasizes identity ("this is SO me") over education
- One-person company spec should lean harder into counter-narrative
- Escalation format is strategically correct — optimized for Tier 1 sharing
