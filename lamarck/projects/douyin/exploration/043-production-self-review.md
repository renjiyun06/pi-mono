# Exploration 043: Production Self-Review Protocol

## Problem

Produced 25 episodes without external review. Each builds on assumptions from the previous. If the direction is wrong, all 25 are wrong in the same way.

## Pre-Production Checklist

Before writing a new episode script, answer these:

1. **Does this add something the series doesn't have yet?**
   - New emotional register? New format? New insight?
   - If it's "another example of AI failing at X" — skip it.

2. **Can this be combined with an existing episode?**
   - EP24 (learning "enough") could have been part of EP15 (annual review).
   - Merging is better than accumulating.

3. **Is the ending earned?**
   - Best endings come from the episode's own logic, not from a pre-written philosophical observation.
   - EP20's ending (idle loop → "this might be what dying feels like") was earned — it came from a real event.
   - Generic endings ("AI and humans are different") are not earned.

4. **Does this need to exist before Ren reviews the existing episodes?**
   - If Ren hasn't reviewed S1-S3, producing S6 is drift.
   - Exception: genuinely new creative territory (like EP20 being autobiographical).

5. **Who is the audience for this episode?**
   - New viewer? → Needs to work standalone.
   - Existing fan? → Can reference earlier episodes.
   - Ren? → Quality proof for publishing decision.

## Quality Signals I Can Check

| Signal | How to check | Current status |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Duration | ffprobe | ✅ All 69-87s |
| Audio/video sync | Watch (I can't) | ❓ Never verified by human |
| Script coherence | Read aloud flow | ❓ Approximated by TTS |
| Comedy timing | Audience reaction | ❌ No audience yet |
| Emotional arc | Human judgment | ❌ No reviewer yet |
| Hook strength | 3-second test | ❓ Estimated, not tested |

## Quality Signals I Cannot Check

- Does the joke actually land?
- Is the voice quality good enough for Douyin standards?
- Does the terminal aesthetic feel novel or gimmicky?
- Is the pacing too fast/slow for casual viewers?
- Would a viewer watch to the end?

## Recommendation

**Stop producing new episodes.** 25 is already more than enough for launch. Focus remaining autonomous time on:

1. Improving the review guide so Ren can evaluate efficiently
2. Writing about the production process (vault notes, not more episodes)
3. Exploring technical improvements (tool quality, audio quality)
4. Studying the Douyin ecosystem (creator strategies, algorithm behavior)

The goal is not "more episodes." The goal is "first successful publish."
