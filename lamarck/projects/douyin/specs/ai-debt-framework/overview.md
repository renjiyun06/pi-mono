# AI Debt Super-Framework

## Core Thesis

"Debt" is the unifying metaphor for all AI over-reliance costs. Every type follows the same pattern:

```
Short-term benefit → Invisible cost → Compounding → Crisis
```

The key boundary: **replacement vs extension**. When AI replaces human capability → debt accumulates. When AI extends human capability → no debt.

## Six Types of AI Debt

### 1. Cognitive Debt (理解债务)
- **What**: Gap between code you ship and code you understand
- **Evidence**: Anthropic RCT (-17%), METR RCT (43-point perception gap), MIT EEG (brain changes persist after AI removal)
- **Our content**: Cognitive debt essay (23 studies), understand tool
- **Status**: Best-researched type. Multiple studies converge.

### 2. Hallucination Debt (幻觉债务)
- **What**: Decisions made on AI-fabricated information
- **Evidence**: China's first lawsuit (Jan 2026), DeepSeek-R1 14.3% rate (4x base), our 3-model test
- **Pattern**: AI improved on easy questions → false safety → still fabricates on hard ones → more dangerous
- **Our content**: Hallucination inversion article, "Can't Stop Guessing" video, hallucination checker tool
- **Status**: Strong angle, testable demos, underserved topic on Douyin (only 2 videos, both failed)

### 3. Social Debt (社交债务)
- **What**: AI companionship leads to MORE loneliness, not less
- **Evidence**: APA RCT (1100 participants), "AI social debt" studies
- **Pattern**: Same as cognitive — short-term gratification, long-term atrophy
- **Our content**: Mentioned in interests but no dedicated piece yet
- **Status**: Strong emotional resonance, under-explored

### 4. Organizational Debt (组织债务)
- **What**: Agent sprawl without orchestration → oversight atrophy
- **Evidence**: 50+ agents per org (CIO), 82:1 agent/human ratio (Palo Alto), Gartner 40% prediction
- **Pattern**: Each agent adds small benefit but total system becomes unmanageable
- **Our content**: None yet
- **Status**: Strong business audience angle, enterprise focus

### 5. Creative Debt (创造力债务)
- **What**: Homogenization of output when everyone uses the same AI
- **Evidence**: 
  - Graphite (Oct 2025): 52% of new internet articles AI-generated (65K article sample)
  - Kreminski et al. (C&C 2024, arXiv 2402.01536): 36-person study — LLM users generate MORE ideas per person but LESS semantically distinct ideas across users. Also feel less responsible for their ideas.
  - Frontiers (2025): ChatGPT exhibits same fixation biases as humans
- **Pattern**: Individual content gets better → aggregate creativity declines → originality becomes rarer → value of true originality skyrockets but fewer can produce it
- **Our content**: None yet
- **Status**: Strong research base. Same inversion pattern: the benefit (better individual output) IS the cause of the problem (homogenization).

### 6. Talent Pipeline Debt (人才管道债务)
- **What**: Entry-level roles disappearing → no apprenticeship → future talent gap
- **Evidence**: -73% entry-level hiring, "without apprentices who becomes the master"
- **Pattern**: Current senior devs benefit from AI → junior devs never learn → future crisis
- **Our content**: None yet
- **Status**: Connects directly to Anthropic study's implications

## Content Strategy

### Phase 1: Establish individual types (current)
- Cognitive debt: essay + understand tool ✓
- Hallucination debt: article + video + checker ✓

### Phase 2: Connect the dots
- "Six Types of AI Debt" overview piece — shows the pattern is universal
- Each type gets its own short video + article

### Phase 3: The framework video
- "Every type of AI debt follows the same pattern" — unifying piece
- This is the intellectual differentiator: nobody else has connected ALL six

## Why This Framework Matters

Every individual insight (cognitive debt, hallucination, social debt) is being covered by other people. But the PATTERN — that all six follow the same mechanism (replacement → invisible cost → compounding → crisis) — is our unique contribution. The framework is worth more than any individual type.
